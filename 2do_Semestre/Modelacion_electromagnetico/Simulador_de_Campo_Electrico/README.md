### **Challenge**
You must create a computer simulation of an electric field like the ones used in Dielectrophoresis to diagnose malaria. The display should show two electrodes in the form of flat plates, parallel and of opposite charge. The user will be able to modify the size of one of the plates, and the screen will graph with arrows or lines of force the non-uniform electric field that the plates produced. In addition, in a box of the simulation, the user can specify the coordinates (x, y, z) of a point between the plates, and the values of the components (Ex, Ey, Ez) of the electric field at that point.

### Solution

The program receives the following inputs for two arrays of dimensions >= 1:
- Position on the axis
- Value of the charge
- Separation between charges on the array

This is performed for each array.

Afterwards the program executes calculations to graph and determine the electrical field between arrays as well as the distance between them.
