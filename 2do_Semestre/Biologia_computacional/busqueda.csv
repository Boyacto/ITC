"Intra-host diversity of hepatitis B virus during mother-to-child transmission: the X gene may play a key role in virus survival in children after transmission.","Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the main route of transmission in Asia, and characterization of HBV quasispecies is needed to further understand virus evolution and adaptation. To understand changes in HBV during mother-to-child transmission, we enrolled nine pairs of mothers and children in the study, including a set of twins. Three groups were infected with HBV genotype C, and six groups were infected with HBV genotype B. The full-length HBV genome was amplified by PCR from serum samples before antiviral treatment, the whole viral genomes from each pair were sequenced, and the complexity and diversity of the quasispecies were analyzed. The entropy of transmitted HBV in children was found to be lower than their mothers, suggesting that there was a bottleneck effect during HBV transmission from the mother to the child. Selective evolution was shown by calculating pN and pS in the whole genomes, and the highest values were obtained for the X gene, which plays a role in viral replication and immune escape. All genotype C patients and only one genotype B pair had a pN/pS greater than 1 ratio, indicating that positive selection had occurred. In addition, quasispecies were found to be different between the twin children despite having the same mother, indicating that virus evolution is host-specific.","32240369"
"Tenofovir prophylaxis for preventing mother-to-child hepatitis B virus transmission in China: a cost-effectiveness analysis.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate whether tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high viral loads in late pregnancy is a cost-effective way to prevent mother-to-child HBV transmission in China.METHODS: A decision tree-Markov model was constructed for a cohort of infants born to HBV surface antigen-positive mothers in China, 2016. The expected cost and effectiveness were compared between the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis strategy and the tenofovir prophylaxis strategy and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. One-way and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: For 100,000 babies born to mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, tenofovir prophylaxis strategy would prevent 2,213 perinatal HBV infections and gain 931 quality-adjusted life years, compared with the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was <U+FFE5>59,973 ($9,087) per QALY gained. This result was robust over a wide range of assumptions.CONCLUSIONS: Tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high viral loads in late pregnancy was more cost-effective than the current active-passive immunoprophylaxis alone. Embedding tenofovir prophylaxis for mothers with high virus loads into the present hepatitis B prevention strategies should be considered to further prevent mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission in China.","32205288"

"Efficacy of oral antiviral drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: a network meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B is a serious global health problem. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor in the endemicity of HBV infection. Oral antiviral drugs are recommended to highly viremic mothers to decrease MTCT of HBV. The present network analysis compared the efficacy of available treatments to prevent the MTCT of HBV.METHODS: The electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Wanfang data were searched for eligible studies. Pair-wise meta-analysis and Bayesian network analysis were applied to compare the efficacy of antiviral drugs.RESULTS: Seventy-five studies involving 12,740 pregnant females were eligible for analysis. On pair-wise analysis, lamivudine (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09-0.25, I-squared<U+2009>=<U+2009>0%), telbivudine (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.10, I-squared<U+2009>=<U+2009>0%) and tenofovir (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.04-0.13, I-squared<U+2009>=<U+2009>0%) significantly decreased the MTCT rate. Results of multiple comparisons with ranking probability based on Bayesian analysis showed that tenofovir (SUCRA<U+2009>=<U+2009>96.83%) appeared more effective than the two other drugs.CONCLUSION: In addition to active and passive immunoprophylaxis, lamivudine, telbivudine and tenofovir in highly viremic mothers can further decrease MTCT of HBV. Based on direct and indirect evidence, tenofovir appears to be more effective than the two other drugs in the prevention of HBV MTCT.","32130674"
"Efficacy of antiviral therapy during the second or the third trimester for preventing mother-to-child hepatitis B virus transmission: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","For pregnant women with high viral load, antiviral therapy has been administered in addition to active and passive immune prophylaxis as a crucial adjunctive therapy to interrupt mother-to-child hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission (MTCT). However, the time of antiviral therapy onset remains controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy of antiviral therapy during the second or the third trimester for prevention of HBV vertical transmission. We searched nine databases for observational studies and randomized controlled trials that enrolled pregnant women with positive HBsAg treated with antivirals. The outcomes of interest were maternal HBV-DNA levels prior to delivery and the rates of HBV MTCT. We included nine studies that enrolled 1,502 pregnant women. The average HBV-DNA level before treatment was approximately 8 log10 copies/mL. Compared to the onset of antiviral intervention in the third trimester, the beginning of treatment in the second trimester distinctly reduced maternal predelivery HBV-DNA levels. However, no significant difference in HBV MTCT was found between the second and third trimester groups. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that there were no significant differences between groups beginning treatment at different times (second or third trimester) with regard to HBV MTCT or other evaluated endpoints. For pregnant women with HBV-DNA levels less than or equal to 8 log10 copies/mL, the beginning of antiviral treatment can be delayed until the third trimester.","32074216"

"Japanese original delayed hepatitis B vaccination provides adequate immunogenicity against mother-to-child hepatitis B virus infection in preterm infants: A nationwide survey in Japan.","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate immunogenicity following Japanese original delayed hepatitis B (HB) vaccinations for prevention of mother-to-child HB infection in preterm infants.METHODS: A nationwide survey in Japan was conducted at certified neonatology facilities in 2014. Eighty-four preterm infants born from a serum hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen-positive mother were included. We collected data on the following parameters: gestational age, birth weight (BW), age at HB vaccination, age at examination of serum anti-HBs titer, and serum anti-HBs titer. The delayed HB vaccination schedule was 3 doses of HB vaccines at 2, 3 and 5 months of age. A seropositive immunogenic response to HB vaccination was defined as an anti-HBs titer =10 mIU/mL. Seropositive rates were calculated in all participants. Four subgroups based on BW were as follows: &lt;1000 g (n = 13), 1000-1499 g (n = 16), 1500-1999 g (n = 26), and =2000 g (n = 29).RESULTS: Among 84 preterm infants who completed the delayed vaccination schedule, 82 (98%) achieved seropositive anti-HBs titer at a median age of 6 months. Seropositive rates of infants &lt;1000 g, 1000-1499 g, 1500-1999 g, and =2000 g were 92%, 94%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.CONCLUSION: The Japanese original delayed HB vaccinations achieved sufficient seropositive rates in preterm infants and provide immunogenicity against mother-to-child HB infection.","31839560"
"Unsatisfying antiviral therapeutic effect in patients with mother-to-child transmissed chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a prospective multi-center clinical study.","BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the progression of liver disease and therapeutic efficacy in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers infected by mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). This study aimed to investigate these two aspects by comparing the adult chronic HBV carriers in MTCT group with those in horizontal transmission group.METHODS: The 683 adult chronic HBV patients qualified for liver biopsy including 191 with MTCT and 492 with horizontal transmission entered the multi-center prospective study from October 2013 to May 2016. Biopsy results from 217 patients at baseline and 78 weeks post antiviral therapy were collected.RESULTS: Patients infected by MTCT were more likely to have e antigen positive (68.6% vs. 58.2%, <U+03C7><U+200A>=<U+200A>-2.491, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.012) than those with horizontal transmission. However, in patients with MTCT, levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.031), Fibroscan (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.013), N-terminal propeptide of Type III procollagen (PIIINP) (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.014), and Laminin (LN) (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.006) were high, in contrast to the patients with horizontal transmission for whom the levels of albumin (ALB) (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.041), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.001) were high. The 47.2% of patients with MTCT and 36.8% of those with horizontal transmission had significant liver fibrosis (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.013). Following antiviral therapy for 78 weeks, 21.2% and 38.0% patients with MTCT and horizontal transmission acquired hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) clearance, respectively (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.043), and the virological response rates were 54.7% and 74.1% in the MTCT and horizontal groups, respectively (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.005). MTCT was a risk factor for HBeAg clearance and virological response.CONCLUSION: Adult patients with MTCT were more prone to severe liver diseases, and the therapeutic efficacy was relatively poor, which underlined the importance of earlier, long-term treatment and interrupting perinatal transmission.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01962155; https://clinicaltrials.gov.","31725459"

"Quasispecies characteristic in &quot;a&quot; determinant region is a potential predictor for the risk of immunoprophylaxis failure of mother-to-child-transmission of sub-genotype C2 hepatitis B virus: a prospective nested case-control study.","OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to explore the correlation between the characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) quasispecies in HBV-infected pregnant women and the risk of immunoprophylaxis failure for their infants.DESIGN: In this prospective nested case-control study, the characteristics of HBV quasispecies in mothers whose infants were immunoprophylaxis success (control group) and those whose infants were immunoprophylaxis failure (case group) were analysed by the clone-based sequencing of full-length HBV genome and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of &quot;a&quot; determinant region, and were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: The quasispecies characteristics including mutant frequency, Shannon entropy and mean genetic distance at amino acid level of &quot;a&quot; determinant region were significantly lower in case group than that in control group, using the full-length HBV genome clone-based sequencing assay. These results were confirmed by NGS assay. Notably, we discovered that the differences were also significant at nucleotide level by NGS assay. Furthermore, the risk of immunoprophylaxis failure could be predicted by analysing the three HBV quasispecies characteristics either at nucleotide level or at amino acid level of &quot;a&quot; determinant region, and the corresponding predictive values were tentatively set up.CONCLUSIONS: HBV quasispecies with a more complex mutant spectrum in &quot;a&quot; determinant region might be more vulnerable to extinct through mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT). More importantly, analysing HBV quasispecies characteristics in pregnant women with high HBV DNA load might be helpful to predict the high-risk population of immunoprophylaxis failure, and consequently provide accurate intervention against MTCT of HBV.","31446427"

"Outcomes of the national programme on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus in China, 2016-2017.","BACKGROUND: In addition to providing free hepatitis B vaccine (HBvacc) series to all infants in China since 2005, the national programme on prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) started providing free hepatitis B immunoglobulin for all new-borns born to hepatitis B surface-antigen (HBsAg) positive mothers in 2010. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the PMTCT programme. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the outcomes of the programme and identify associated factors.METHOD: Using a cross-sectional study design, we collected data on 4112 pairs of HBsAg-positive mothers and their children aged 7-22<U+2009>months in four representative provinces through interviews and medical record review. We tested HBsAg and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) of children by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at designated maternal and child hospital laboratories. We used logistic regression to analyse factors associated with child HBsAg and anti-HBs positivity.RESULTS: Thirty-five children were HBsAg positive, indicating the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate was 0.9% (0.6-1.1%). The anti-HBs positive rate was 96.8% (96.3-97.4%). Children receiving HBvacc between 12 and 24<U+2009>h of birth were 2.9 times more likely to be infected than those vaccinated in less than 12<U+2009>h (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-6.3, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01). Maternal hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) positivity was associated with higher MTCT rate (aOR<U+2009>=<U+2009>79.1, 95% CI: 10.8-580.2, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009> 0.001) and lower anti-HBs positive rate (aOR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009> 0.001). Children with low birth weight (LBW) were 60% less likely to be anti-HBs positive than those with normal birth weight (aOR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The MTCT rate was lower than the 2030 WHO elimination goal, which implies the programme is on track to achieve this target. As earlier HBvacc birth dose (HBvcc-BD) was associated with lower MTCT rate, we suggest that the PMTCT programme work with the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to modify the current recommendation for early HBvcc-BD to a requirement. Our finding that LBW was associated with lower anti-HBs positivity points to the need for further studies to understand factors associated with these risks and opportunities for program strengthening. The programme needs to ensure providing essential test to identify HBeAg-positive mothers and their infants and provide them with appropriate medical care and follow-up.","31378202"

"Modelling cost-effectiveness of tenofovir for prevention of mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in South Africa.","BACKGROUND: International sustainable development goals for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health problem by 2030 highlight the need to optimize strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. An important priority for Africa is to have affordable, accessible and sustainable prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programmes, delivering screening and treatment for antenatal women and implementing timely administration of HBV vaccine for their babies.METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model simulating 10,000 singleton pregnancies to assess the cost-effectiveness of three possible strategies for deployment of tenofovir in pregnancy, in combination with routine infant vaccination: S1: no screening nor antiviral therapy; S2: screening and antiviral prophylaxis for all women who test HBsAg-positive; S3: screening for HBsAg, followed by HBeAg testing and antiviral prophylaxis for women who are HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive. Our outcome was cost per infant HBV infection avoided and the analysis followed a healthcare perspective.RESULTS: Based on 10,000 pregnancies, S1 predicts 45 infants would be HBV-infected at six months of age, compared to 21 and 28 infants in S2 and S3, respectively. Relative to S1, S2 had an incremental cost of $3940 per infection avoided. S3 led to more infections and higher costs.CONCLUSION: Given the long-term health burden for individuals and economic burden for society associated with chronic HBV infection, screening pregnant women and providing tenofovir for all who test HBsAg+ may be a cost-effective strategy for South Africa and other low/middle income settings.","31242901"

We screened 1050 HBV-positive male patients. Reasons for not receiving antivirals in 150 patients were &quot;did not meet criteria for antiviral therapy,&quot; fertility, and financial. Furthermore, 900 participants received antivirals (85.71%, 900/1050), including 792 patients with children and 15.15% (120/792) took anti-HBV treatment when preparing for pregnancy. Based on whether they received antiviral therapy during conception or not, we divided patients into two groups. In the child-bearing age group, 88.33% (106/120) of patients received telbivudine (LDT), whereas the other group mainly received entecavir (ETV) (87.20%, 586/672). No significant difference occurred in birth defect incidence rates between both groups. Furthermore, 558 physicians completed questionnaires. Reasons that influenced drug selection were &quot;patient's condition,&quot; &quot;fertility demand,&quot; &quot;financial condition,&quot; and &quot;compliance.&quot; Telbivudine was the first-choice drug (32.80%, 183/558) while tenofovir (TDF) was the second (2.69%, 15/558). Additionally, 61.47% of physicians considered telbivudine or tenofovir as the first choice for male patients who met antiviral criteria, whereas 19% suggested delayed therapy and follow-up until childbirth. No significant changes occurred in semen volume, concentration, mobility, and percentage before and after administration of anti-HBV nucleoside analogs, which did not affect male fertility and birth defect incidence while the desire for pregnancy influenced drug selection and timing of administration. Further research on the effects of analogs on male fertility and fetal safety is required.","31058113"
"Hepatitis B virus infection: Prevention of mother-to-child transmission and exacerbation during pregnancy.","The aims of this study were to assess the effect of maternal screening for hepatitis B (HB) virus and a perinatal prevention program of mother-to-child transmission, and to identify clinical characteristics and findings associated with HB exacerbation during pregnancy. This prospective cohort study enrolled 3796 pregnant women and their neonates with informed consent. Pregnant women underwent maternal universal screening for HBs antigen (Ag) in the first trimester. If HBs Ag was positive, serum levels of HBe Ag, alanine transaminase (AST), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), and HB virus (HBV) DNA were measured. All neonates delivered from HBs Ag-positive women were given HB immune globulin and HB vaccine based on the guidelines of the perinatal prevention program. Of the 3796 pregnant women, 40 (1.05%) tested positive for HBs Ag. Three (7.5%) of the 40 HBs Ag-positive women experienced exacerbation of HBV infection during pregnancy. Serum levels of AST (median 776 vs. 22 mIU/ml, p &lt; 0.01), ALT (median 325 vs. 15 mIU/ml, p &lt; 0.01), and HBV-DNA (median 9.1 vs. 5.4 log copies/ml, p &lt; 0.05), and frequencies of HBe Ag-positive (100% vs. 29.7%, p &lt; 0.05) and symptoms of itching or general fatigue (66.7% vs. 0%, p &lt; 0.01) in three women with exacerbation of HBV infection were significantly higher than those in 37 women without exacerbation. There was no case of mother-to-child transmission, suggesting the perinatal HBV prevention program was effective. Levels of HBe Ag, liver enzymes, and HBV-DNA as well as symptoms of itching and general fatigue should be carefully monitored for HBs Ag-positive women during pregnancy and the postpartum period.","30982723"

"Horizontal Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus From Mother to Child Due to Immune Escape Despite Immunoprophylaxis.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination starting at birth is approximately 95% effective in preventing mother-to-child transmission to infants born to HBV-infected mothers. A higher risk of transmission is associated with birth to a highly viremic mother, often due to transplacental exposure, while later horizontal transmission is much less common, particularly following complete vaccination. This study reports a case of infection in an older child despite appropriate immunoprophylaxis starting at birth and an apparent protective immune response post-vaccination. Two immune escape mutations within the antigenic determinant of the surface antigen-coding region were observed in the child's dominant HBV sequence, whereas the maternal HBV variant lacked mutations at both sites. Ultra-deep sequencing confirmed the presence of 1 mutation at low levels within the maternal HBV quasispecies population, suggesting early exposure to the child followed by viral evolution resulting in immunoprophylaxis escape and chronic infection.","30889137"

"Progress Toward Hepatitis B Control and Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus - Western Pacific Region, 2005-2017.","Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), which has been available since 1982, provides lifelong protection against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the associated 20%-30% increased lifetime risk for developing cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma among &gt;95% of vaccine recipients (1). Before HepB introduction into national childhood immunization schedules, the estimated hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR)* was &gt;8% in 1990 (2). In 2005, the WPR was the first WHO region to establish a hepatitis B control goal, with an initial target of reducing HBsAg prevalence to &lt;2% among children aged 5 years by 2012. In 2013, the WPR set more stringent control targets to achieve by 2017, including reducing HBsAg prevalence to &lt;1% in children aged 5 years and increasing national coverage with both timely HepB birth dose (HepB-BD) (defined as administration within 24 hours of birth) and the third HepB dose (HepB3) to =95% (3). All WPR countries/areas endorsed the Regional Action Plan for Viral Hepatitis in the Western Pacific Region 2016-2020 in 2015 (4) and the Regional Framework for the Triple Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Syphilis in Asia and the Pacific 2018-2030 (triple elimination framework) in 2017 (5). These regional targets and strategies are aligned with program targets established by the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016-2021 that aim to reduce HBsAg prevalence among children aged 5 years to =1% by 2020 and to =0.1% by 2030 (6). This report describes progress made to achieve hepatitis B control in the WPR and the steps taken to eliminate mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV during 2005-2017. During this period, regional timely HepB-BD and HepB3 coverage increased from 63% to 85% and from 76% to 93%, respectively. As of December 2017, 15 (42%) countries/areas achieved =95% timely HepB-BD coverage; 18 (50%) reached =95% HepB3 coverage; and 19 (53%) countries/areas as well as the region as a whole were verified to have achieved the regional and global target of &lt;1% HBsAg prevalence among children aged 5 years. Continued implementation of proven vaccination strategies will be needed to make further progress toward WPR hepatitis B control targets. In addition to high HepB-BD and HepB3 coverage, enhanced implementation of complementary hepatitis B prevention services through the triple elimination framework, including routine HBsAg testing of pregnant women, timely administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin to exposed newborns, and antiviral treatment of mothers with high viral loads, will be needed to achieve the global hepatitis B elimination target by 2030.","30817746"

"Mother-to-child transmission prevention of human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis and hepatitis B virus.","BACKGROUND: China is the first country to initiate a nationwide program for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis and hepatitis B virus by an integrated approach. However, the progress of this program remains unreported at national or local level for China. Therefore, we performed a hospital-based longitudinal study to assess the integrated prevention effect in Hunan, South-central China.METHODS: This study was conducted at 123 counties in Hunan and covered all local hospitals providing midwifery and antenatal care services from 2010 to 2016. We used the Cochran-Armitage test to examine the temporal changes of the indicators related with prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Besides, we used Spearman rank correlation analysis to assess the association between mother-to-child transmission rates and the process indicators related with prevention of mother-to-child transmission.RESULTS: After implementation of integrated prevention program, the indicators related with prevention of mother-to-child transmission are moving in the right direction. From 2010 to 2016, mother-to-child transmission rates significantly decreased from 19.4% to 9.6% for human immunodeficiency virus, and from 116.3 to 13.6 cases per 100,000 live births for syphilis. The proportion of children receiving hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection within 24h after birth increased from 95.2% to 98.9% among exposed neonates. Mother-to-child transmission rates were negatively associated with the process indicators related with prevention of mother-to-child transmission (all P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our prevention program of mother-to-child transmission for three diseases by an integrated approach proved to be viable and effective. Our model may be of interest to other countries.","30497906"
"Efficacy and safety of antiviral treatment on blocking the mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: A meta-analysis.","Nucleo(t)side analogues (NAs) have been administered as adjunctive therapy to interrupt the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The efficacy and safety of this method remain controversial. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NAs treatment during pregnancy. The differences among different agents and initiation trimesters were analysed. A total of 9228 mother-infant pairs in 59 studies (32 RCTs and 27 non-RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. NAs significantly reduced the risk of MTCT, as indicated by seropositivity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (risk ratio (RR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.57) and HBV DNA in newborns (RR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.18-0.26). No differences in the efficacy of interrupting HBV MTCT were evident among lamivudine, telbivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. NA was more effective when administered from the second than from the third trimester as indicated by HBV DNA (RR: the second vs the third 0.08 vs 0.22, P = 0.010), but this effect was not evident as indicated by HBsAg (RR: the second vs the third 0.46 vs 0.53, P = 0.596). Antiviral treatment initiated from the second trimester did not confer a higher risk of safety problems in the newborns compared with treatment from the third trimester, as indicated by weight (P = 0.064), length (P = 0.491) and malformation rate (P = 0.635) of newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Lamivudine, telbivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are equally effective in blocking HBV MTCT. Antiviral treatment can be applied from the second trimester, without obvious safety concerns.","30417469"

The China Foundation of Hepatitis Prevention and Control organized a team of specialists in infectious diseases, hepatology, immunology, obstetrics, and public health to develop an algorithm for interrupting MTCT of HBV, based on the most recent hepatitis B guidelines and latest evidence. This algorithm comprises 10 steps and has been adopted in clinical practice in China. Four aspects (screening, antiviral intervention during pregnancy, immunoprophylaxis, and postvaccination serologic testing) are the core components of preventing MTCT. Although the combination of passive and active immunization in newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers reduces MTCT of HBV, this immunoprophylaxis cannot completely eradicate MTCT. In the past decade, administration of antiviral agents to pregnant women has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing MTCT of HBV in combination with immunoprophylaxis. Aiming to achieve zero MTCT, this algorithm recommends the use of antivirals during pregnancy by women with high viral loads. Preventing MTCT is key to achieving the goal of eliminating HBV as a public health threat by 2030. Implementation and enhancement of the standardized algorithm for pregnant women with chronic HBV infection and their infants is urgently needed to prevent MTCT.","30312789"

"[Getting to zero mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: dream and challenge].","To eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, the World Health Organization has set the ambitious goal of reducing the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in children to 0.1% by 2030, and the key to this grand goal is cutting off hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission from mother-to-child. Previously, national and international guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B recommended the use of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) or combination of any in neonates and antiviral drugs for pregnant women with high viral load in late pregnancy. However, a recent study in Thailand found that the addition of antiviral drugs in pregnant women with high viral load in the third trimester did not significantly lower the incidence of mother-to-child HBV transmission, but no case of chronic HBV infection was seen with strict standards hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG combined immunoprophylaxis and the use of tenofovir disoproxil in pregnant women with high viral load in the third trimester. In addition, the incidence of mother -to- child transmission of HBV in the antiviral group was 0, while the incidence of HBV transmission in the placebo group was 2%. Therefore, it is not possible to deny the efficacy of adding antiviral drugs in treating pregnant women with high viral load in the third trimester with combined immunoprophylaxis. There is an urgent need for more real-world studies in clinical practice to further reveal the principles and existing problems of mother- to- child transmission of HBV.","29996336"

"Hepatitis B virus serosurvey and awareness of mother-to-child transmission among pregnant women in Shenyang, China: An observational study.","Preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV) mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the key to controlling the prevalence of chronic HBV infection. Adequate awareness of hepatitis B in hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) positive pregnant women may be helpful to reduce HBV MTCT.The aim of this study was to explore HBV seroprevalence among pregnant women and investigate the level of hepatitis B awareness among HBsAg positive pregnant women.HBV serum biomarkers were tested among pregnant women visiting Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. HBsAg-positive pregnant women received a HBV DNA test and completed a questionnaire. The different HBV DNA loads were interpreted as follows: 20 to <U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>2<U+200A>×<U+200A>10<U+200A>IU/mL was low viral load, 2<U+200A>×<U+200A>10 to <U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>2<U+200A>×<U+200A>10<U+200A>IU/mL was intermediate viral load and =2<U+200A>×<U+200A>10<U+200A>IU/mL was high viral load. The pregnant women with high viral load were treated with telbivudine (LdT). HBV DNA at different times was tested. The rate of HBV MTCT was confirmed at 28 weeks postpartum.HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women was 3.1% (441/14314). There was significant difference in comparing HBsAg prevalence in different age groups (<U+03C7><U+200A>=<U+200A>13.86, P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.01). Among 441 HBsAg-positive pregnant women, 151 (34.2%) were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive and 112 (25.4%) had high viral load. After 4 weeks of treatment, the average HBV DNA load of 66 cases with high viral load was (5.0<U+200A>±<U+200A>0.8) log10<U+200A>IU/mL. The average HBV DNA load at 4 weeks postpartum rebounded to (7.9<U+200A>±<U+200A>1.0) log10<U+200A>IU/mL, which was not significantly different from that at baseline (t<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.23, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.22). At 28 weeks postpartum, the rate of HBV MTCT in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the observation group (0% vs 12.2%; P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.02). Only 23.4% of pregnant women knew their HBV status before gestation and 17.7% of pregnant women knew the HBV status before delivery. However, only 21.3% of pregnant women realized to need antiviral treatment to prevent MTCT.The pregnant women in Shenyang had a low HBsAg prevalence. Antiviral treatment for pregnant women with high viral load can effectively reduce the rate of HBV MTCT. HBV screening and education among HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be strengthened.","29851831"

"Fulminant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in an infant following mother-to-child transmission of an e-minus HBV mutant: Time to relook at HBV prophylaxis in South African infants.","The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women is high in South Africa (SA), yet prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) falls short of international recommendations. We describe a 10-week-old infant who developed fulminant hepatic failure following MTCT. The mother was hepatitis e-antibody positive and had a viral load of only 760 IU/mL. Genetic analysis of virus from mother and infant showed that both had the G1896A mutation in the preC/C gene, which truncates hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg) during translation, causing an HBeAg-negative phenotype. HBeAg attenuates antiviral immune responses, and its absence was probably responsible for the infant's fulminant hepatitis, due to an uncontrolled immune attack on infected liver cells. Pregnant women are not tested for HBV infection in SA and MTCT rates are unknown. Addition of a birth dose of vaccine, HBV screening of pregnant women and antiviral prophylaxis to positive mothers should be prioritised.","29843851"

"Cesarean section to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus in China: A meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is predominantly transmitted through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). To date, it remains unclear whether the method of parturition affects MTCT of HBV. In order to clarify whether cesarean section, when compared with vaginal delivery, could reduce the risk of MTCT of HBV in China, we conducted this meta-analysis.METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed of the PubMed (Medline), Embase, ISI Web of Science, China Biological Medicine Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals databases for articles written in English or Chinese through July 2015.The reference lists of relevant articles were also scrutinized for additional papers. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, or case-control studies investigating the effect of delivery mode on MTCT of HBV were included.CONCLUSIONS: Cesarean section could reduce the risk of MTCT of HBV in comparison to vaginal delivery in China. However, owing to several limitations of our meta-analysis, future well-designed randomized controlled trials with adequate statistical power, might be a more appropriate next step.","28899348"

"Chemotherapy for a child with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia complicated with persistent hepatitis C virus infection.","An 8-year-old Mongolian female was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and treated at a hospital in Mongolia according to the BFM-AML2004 SR protocol. Although complete remission (CR) was achieved, chemotherapy was interrupted because of shortage of drugs. The patient moved to Japan 7 months after diagnosis. Screening for viral infection revealed the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and RNA. At 11 months after initial diagnosis, the patient experienced bone marrow relapse and a RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcript was detected. Considering the inadequate intensity of initial treatment and the persistent HCV infection, chemotherapy was preferred and initiated over hematopoietic cell transplantation. After the first course of induction therapy, a second CR was confirmed and the chimeric transcript disappeared. The viral load mildly increased during myelosuppression and transient elevation of liver enzymes was observed along with hematological recovery. HCV infection remained stable, without progression to reactivation of hepatitis C. Given the high risk of second relapse and liver fibrosis and sclerosis following chronic HCV infection, treatment against HCV may be indicated during second remission.","28679992"

"Hepatitis B immunoglobulin during pregnancy for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","Hepatitis is a viral infection of the liver. It is mainly transmitted between people through contact with infected blood, frequently from mother to baby in-utero. Hepatitis B poses significant risk to the fetus and up to 85% of infants infected by their mothers at birth develop chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) is a purified solution of human immunoglobulin that could be administered to the mother, newborn, or both. HBIG offers protection against HBV infection when administered to pregnant women who test positive for hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or both. When HBIG is administered to pregnant women, the antibodies passively diffuse across the placenta to the child. This materno-fetal diffusion is maximal during the third trimester of pregnancy. Up to 1% to 9% infants born to HBV-carrying mothers still have HBV infection despite the newborn receiving HBIG plus active HBV vaccine in the immediate neonatal period. This suggests that additional intervention such as HBIG administration to the mother during the antenatal period could be beneficial to reduce the transmission rate in utero.</AbstractText>: Hepatitis is a viral infection of the liver.

"[Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus].","Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is a major mode of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission, especially in high endemic areas. Administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine to infants at birth, followed by completion of the vaccine series, prevented approximately 95% of HBV transmission from HBsAg-positive mothers to their infants. However, immunoprophylaxis failure was still observed in 5~10% infants born to mothers with high levels of viremia. It was demonstrated that antiviral nucleot(s)ide analogues (NUCs) provided to pregnant women with high viral loads in late pregnancy further reduced MTCT. This paper discussed criteria of antiviral treatment for prevention of MTCT including threshold of HBV DNA level in pregnant women, time of starting treatment, time of stopping treatment, and kind of NUCs. The route of hepatitis B vaccine administration was also discussed.","28073406"

"Evaluation of the G145R Mutant of the Hepatitis B Virus as a Minor Strain in Mother-to-Child Transmission.","The role of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant G145R, with a single change in amino acid 145 of the surface protein, as a minor population remains unknown in mother-to-child transmission. The minor strain as well as the major strain of the G145R mutant were evaluated in three cohorts using a locked nucleic acid probe-based real-time PCR. The breakthrough cohort consisted of children who were born to HBV carrier mothers and became HBV carriers despite immnoprophylaxis (n = 25). The control cohort consisted of HBV carriers who had no history of receiving the hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin or antiviral treatment (n = 126). The pregnant cohort comprised pregnant women with chronic HBV infection (n = 31). In the breakthrough cohort, 6 showed positive PCR results (major, 2; minor, 4). In the control cohort, 13 showed positive PCR results (major, 0; minor, 13). HBeAg-positive patients were prone to have the G145R mutant as a minor population. Deep sequencing was performed in a total of 32 children (PCR positive, n = 13; negative, n = 19). In the breakthrough cohort, the frequency of the G145R mutant ranged from 0.54% to 6.58%. In the control cohort, the frequency of the G145R mutant ranged from 0.42% to 4.1%. Of the 31 pregnant women, 4 showed positive PCR results (major, n = 0; minor, n = 4). All of the pregnant women were positive for HBeAg and showed a high viral load. Three babies born to 3 pregnant women with the G145R mutant were evaluated. After the completion of immunoprophylaxis, 2 infants became negative for HBsAg. The remaining infant became negative for HBsAg after the first dose of HB vaccine. G145R was detected in one-fourth of the children with immunoprophylaxis failure. However, the pre-existence of the G145R mutant as a minor population in pregnant women does not always cause breakthrough infection in infants.","27812178"

In the late-treatment group, 55 women terminated telbivudine therapy within puerperium. All neonates underwent routine hepatitis B immunoglobulin plus vaccination. Mothers and infants were followed for 7 months after birth.Pregnancy outcomes were similar among the 3 groups. HBV MTCT rates in the early and late treatment and control groups were 0, 0, and 4.69%, respectively. The rates of infant vaccination success among the 3 groups were similar, as were neonatal outcomes including birth weights, asphyxia, hyperbilirubinemia, Apgar score, birth defects, and weight and height at 7 months. Puerperal discontinuation of telbivudine did not increase the alanine transaminase value at 7 months after birth, but increased serum HBV DNA levels, and rates of positive hepatitis Be-antigen.Telbivudine treatment in HBV-infected pregnant women was associated with lower serum HBV DNA levels and reduced rates of HBV MTCT; there were no associated changes in pregnancy or neonatal outcomes at birth or 7 months after birth, or in the rate of infant vaccination success. Puerperal drug withdrawal after short-term antiviral therapy will not influence hepatic function, but may increase virus replication.","27749537"

Related parameters of Shenzhen were introduced to the model, a birth cohort was set up as the study population in 2013. The net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated and the differences between CBA and CEA were compared.RESULTS: A decision tree was built as the decision analysis model for hepatitis B immunization. Three kinds of Markov models were used to simulate the outcomes after the implementation of vaccination program. The PMTCT strategy of Shenzhen showed a net-gain as 38 097.51 Yuan/per person in 2013, with BCR as 14.37. The universal vaccination strategy showed a net-gain as 37 083.03 Yuan/per person, with BCR as 12.07. Data showed that the PMTCT strategy was better than the universal vaccination one and would end with gaining more economic benefit. When comparing with the universal vaccination program, the PMTCT strategy would save 85 100.00 Yuan more on QALY gains for every person. The PMTCT strategy seemed more cost-effective compared with the one under universal vaccination program. In the CBA and CEA hepatitis B immunization programs, the immunization coverage rate and costs of hepatitis B related diseases were the most important influencing factors. Outcomes of joint-changes of all the parameters in CEA showed that PMTCT strategy was a more cost-effective.CONCLUSIONS: The PMTCT strategy gained more economic benefit and effects on health. However, the cost of PMTCT strategy was more than the universal vaccination program, thus it is important to pay attention to the process of PMTCT strategy and the universal vaccination program. CBA seemed suitable for strategy optimization while CEA was better for strategy evaluation. Hopefully, programs as combination of the above said two methods would facilitate the process of economic evaluation.","27346114"

Serum markers of hepatitis B in the children at high risk of hepatitis B were measured. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HBV.RESULTS: The rate of hepatitis B vaccination in the children at high risk of hepatitis B was 100%, and 96.6% received injections of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). The HBsAg positive rate showed no significant differences between different age groups. The HBsAb positive rate gradually decreased with the increasing age (P&lt;0.01). The children born to HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive mothers had a significantly higher hepatitis B infection rate than those born to HBsAg-positive mothers (15.1% vs 0.2%; P&lt;0.01). The high-risk children who received hepatitis B vaccination alone had a significantly higher hepatitis B infection rate than those who received both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG injections (28.6% vs 2.8%; P&lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The HBsAb positive rate gradually decreases with the increasing age in children at high risk of hepatitis B. Maternal HBsAg and HBeAg positivity and the absence of HBIG combined with hepatitis B vaccine injections for children at high risk of hepatitis B are the risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HBV.","27165589"

Of these, 141 patients also had pathologically proven cirrhosis. Sixteen patients with hepatitis B and C virus-related HCC with Child B or C cirrhosis were included in the study. Thirteen (81.3%) patients had Child B disease and three (18.8%) patients had Child C disease.RESULTS: The median operation time was 215 min, the median estimated blood loss was 350 mL, and the median hospital stay was eight days. Three patients (18.8%) experienced complications after surgery. There was no postoperative mortality or reoperation. The mean follow-up period was 51.6 months. HCC recurred in eight (50%) patients: seven intrahepatic recurrences and one extrahepatic recurrence. The treatments for recurrence were laparoscopic reoperation in one (6.3%) patient, trans-catheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) in one (6.3%) patient, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in one (6.3%) patient, and combined TACE and RFA in four (25%) patients. The five-year postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 84.4% and 41.7%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that LLR can be safely used in patients with hepatitis B and C virus-related HCC and Child B or C cirrhosis, with acceptable survival outcomes.","26734621"

"Low mother-to-child-transmission rate of Hepatitis C virus in cART treated HIV-1 infected mothers.","BACKGROUND: Maternal transmission is the most common cause of HCV infection in children. HIV co-infection and high levels of plasma HCV-RNA have been associated with increased HCV transmission rates.OBJECTIVES: We assessed the vertical HCV transmission rate in the HIV-HCV co-infected group of pregnant women on cART.STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study in a Dutch cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women and their children. We identified co-infected mothers. Results of the HCV tests of the children were obtained.RESULTS: All 21 women were on cART at the time of delivery. We analyzed data of the 24 live-born children at risk for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HCV between 1996 and 2009. HIV-RNA was &lt;500 copies/ml during 18/24 [75%] deliveries, the median CD4(+) cell count was 419 cells/µl (290-768). There was no transmission of HIV. The median plasma HCV-RNA in our cohort of 23 non-transmitting deliveries in 21 women was 3.5×10E5 viral eq/ml (IQR 9.6×104-1.5×106veq/mL). One of 24 live-born children was found to be infected with HCV genotype 1. At the time of delivery the maternal plasma HIV-RNA was &lt;50 copies/ml, the CD4(+) cell count was 160 cells/µl and maternal plasma HCV-RNA was 4.6×10E6 veq/ml. This amounted to a prevalence of HCV-MTCT of 4%.CONCLUSION: In this well-defined cohort of HIV-HCV co-infected pregnant women, all treated with cART during pregnancy, a modest rate of vertical HCV transmission was observed.","26071328"
"Distinct quasispecies characteristics and positive selection within the core gene in chronic hepatitis B virus infected child and adult patients.","There are significant differences in clinical characteristics between chronic hepatitis B virus infected (CHB) child and adult patients. Viral quasispecies characteristics are associated with its pathogenic properties. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), its core region is the main immune recognition region for its enriched epitopes. In our study, we discuss the quasispecies characteristics and positive selection within core gene within chronic HBV infected child and adult patients. By analyzing 170 core gene sequences from child CHB patients and 121 core genes sequences from adult CHB patients, quasispecies characteristics were described by sequence complexity, diversity, non-synonymous substitution ratio (dN) and synonymous substitution ratios (dS). In addition, positive selection sites were also determined by bioinformatics tools. Then, all these parameters were compared between child and adult CHB patient groups. Compared with child patients, adult patients with CHB showed distinct quasispecies characteristics within the core region, had a higher sequence complexity and diversity and more positive selection sites, suggesting that the adult CHB patients had a higher immune selection pressure on the HBV core gene. Reduced selection pressure on the HBV core gene in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB patients than HBeAg negative CHB patients were observed in both adult and child patient groups. The majority of the screened positive selection sites lay within human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-restricted epitopes. In conclusion, this study analyzed the quasispecies characteristics discrepancy between child and adult patients with CHB, and revealed the possible reason for the distinct clinical characteristics in the perspective of population genetics.","25998435"
"Factors associated with mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus despite immunoprophylaxis.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess risk factors for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after immunoprophylaxis.METHODS: Risk factors for MTCT were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model.PATIENTS: We enrolled 256 mother-child pairs with positive maternal hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg) between January 2010 and June 2013. All children received passive-active immunization after birth. The children were tested for HBsAg at birth and 6-12 months and/or 1-3 years of age.RESULTS: Among 256 children, 10 (3.9%) developed HBV infection, all of whom were born to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive mothers with a high HBV DNA level (median, 7.36; range, 6.75-8.00 log10 IU/mL). A total of 20 mothers received antiviral treatment during pregnancy. The maternal viral load decreased from an average of 7.16 to 3.08 log10 IU/mL (p&lt;0.0001) at delivery. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a high maternal HBV DNA level [odds ratio (OR) for each log10 IU/mL increase, 2.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-5.29, p=0.023] and vaginal delivery (OR=6.96, 95% CI, 1.80-26.93, p=0.005) were risk factors for HBV immunoprophylaxis failure.CONCLUSION: Additional treatment strategies should be considered in HBeAg-positive mothers with an HBV DNA level above 6-7 log10 IU/mL. In addition, our study supports the use of Cesarean section for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.","25832930"
"Mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus: a cause for concern.","Mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important public health issue. India introduced HBV vaccine in 10 states as part of its Universal Immunization Program (UIP). Here we show evidence of mother-to-child transmission of HBV in three families from Jharkhand and Bihar states where HBV vaccination is not yet included in the UIP. This report illustrates the need for active screening of HBV in pregnant women and implementation of HBV vaccine across all states in India to reduce the burden of disease. ","25657134"
"Pharmacokinetics of Sublingual Buprenorphine and Naloxone in Subjects with Mild to Severe Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C), in Hepatitis C Virus-Seropositive Subjects, and in Healthy Volunteers.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Suboxone(®) is a sublingual tablet of buprenorphine/naloxone, approved for the treatment of opioid dependence. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of hepatic impairment or hepatitis C virus infection on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine or naloxone and their major metabolites.METHODS: Forty-three subjects received a single dose of a Suboxone 2.0/0.5-mg tablet. Blood samples were collected up to 168 h and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of covariance.RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from 33 subjects. Compared with healthy subjects, for patients with severe hepatic impairment, total and peak exposures increased to 281.4 % [90 % confidence interval 187.1-423.3] and 171.8 % [117.9-250.2] for buprenorphine, 1401.9 % [707.6-2777.5] and 1129.8 % [577.2-2211.4] for naloxone. For moderate hepatic impaired subjects, naloxone total and peak exposure increased to 317.6 % [164.9-611.5] and 270.0  % [141.9-513.9]. For buprenorphine, only total exposure increased to 163.9 % [110.8-242.3]. Changes in maximum observed plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last quantifiable concentration, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity of buprenorphine or naloxone in subjects with mild hepatic impairment or with hepatitis C virus infection were within twofold of those of healthy subjects. Serious adverse events were not observed.CONCLUSIONS: Severe and moderate hepatic impairment significantly increased exposure of naloxone and to a lesser extent of buprenorphine. Therefore, buprenorphine/naloxone combination products should generally be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone [Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01846455].","25603822"
"Integrated prevention of mother-to-child transmission for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis and hepatitis B virus in China.","PROBLEM: China continues to face challenges in eliminating mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis and hepatitis B virus (HBV).APPROACH: In 2010, a programme that integrated and standardized prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) efforts for HIV, syphilis and HBV was implemented in 1156 counties. At participating antenatal care clinics, pregnant women were offered all three tests concurrently and free of charge. Further interventions such as free treatment, prophylaxis and testing for mothers and their children were provided for HIV and syphilis.LOCAL SETTING: China's national PMTCT HIV programme started in 2003, at which time there were no national programmes for perinatal syphilis and HBV. In 2009, the rate of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV was 8.1% (57/702). Reported congenital syphilis was 60.8 per 100,000 live births. HBV infection was 7.2% of the overall population infected.RELEVANT CHANGES: Between 2010 and 2013 the number of pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics with integrated PMTCT services increased from 5.5 million to 13.1 million. In 2013, 12.7 million pregnant women were tested for HIV, 12.6 million for syphilis and 12.7 million for HBV. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV fell to 6.7% in 2013. Data on syphilis transmission are not yet available.LESSONS LEARNT: Integrated PMTCT services proved to be feasible and effective, and they are now part of the routine maternal and child health services provided to infected women. The services are provided through a collaboration between maternal and child health clinics, the national and local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and general hospitals.La Chine est toujours confrontée à des difficultés dans l'élimination de la transmission mère-enfant du virus de l'immunodéficience humaine (VIH), de la syphilis et du virus de l'hépatite B (VHB).</AbstractText>: La Chine est toujours confrontée à des difficultés dans l'élimination de la transmission mère-enfant du virus de l'immunodéficience humaine (VIH), de la syphilis et du virus de l'hépatite B (VHB).En 2010, un programme qui intégrait et harmonisait les efforts de la prévention de la transmission mère-enfant (PTME) pour le VIH, la syphilis et le VHB, a été mis en uvre dans 1156 pays.

"Immunization interventions to interrupt hepatitis B virus mother-to-child transmission: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the clinical efficacy of various immune interventions on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV).METHODS: We retrieved different immune strategies on how to prevent MTCT reported in the literature from Chinese and English electronic databases from the viewpoint of intrauterine and extrauterine prevention. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) methods were used.RESULTS: Twenty-five articles on intrauterine prevention and 16 on extrauterine prevention were included in the analysis. Intrauterine prevention could reduce infants' HBV infection rate (RR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36, 95% CI: 0.28-0.45) and increase their anti-hepatitis B surface-positive rate (RR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.42, 95% CI: 1.46-4.01) at birth. Compared with passive immunization, passive-active immunization could reduce infants' HBV infection rate (RR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.66, 95% CI: 0.52-0.84) at birth, even at more than 12 months of age (RR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.54, 95% CI: 0.42-0.69). Subgroup analysis demonstrated similar results except for pregnant women who were hepatitis B surface antigen-positive. Funnel plots and Egger's tests showed publication bias mainly in intrauterine prevention not in extrauterine one.CONCLUSIONS: The long-term protective effect of pregnant women injected with hepatitis B immunoglobulin during pregnancy should be further validated by large-scale randomized trials. Newborns of pregnant women who carried HBV should undergo a passive-active immunization strategy.","25526664"

"Hepatitis B virus mother-to-child transmission among HIV-infected women receiving lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens during pregnancy and breastfeeding.","The study included 309 HIV-infected pregnant women receiving a lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimen from week 25 of gestational age until 6 months postpartum, during breastfeeding. Twenty-seven of them (8.7%) were hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) positive; at baseline, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels &gt;3 log(10) IU/mL (with a median level of 6.2 log(10) IU/mL) were found in 10 women, who at one, three and six months postpartum had median levels of 5.2 log(10) IU/mL, 4.5 log(10) IU/mL and 2.8 log(10) IU/mL, respectively. Twenty-four of the 30 breast milk samples evaluated had undetectable HBV DNA and the other six had values between 15 and 155 IU/mL. Median lamivudine concentrations were 1070 ng/mL in serum and 684 ng/mL in breast milk. Among the 24 HBV-exposed children with available samples, 16 always tested negative, four had a transient infection, one had an undetermined status and three (12.5%) first tested positive at Month 12 or Month 24. Among the children born to the HBV-uninfected mothers of the same cohort, the rate of HBsAg positivity at 12-24 months was 2% (4/196). Our finding of the absence of significative levels of HBV DNA in the breast milk of co-infected mothers supports the present recommendations for breastfeeding in HBV-infected women. Horizontal transmission can be hypothesized for the infections detected in children at 12-24 months. Children born to HBV-positive mothers remained at higher risk of postnatal HBV acquisition compared to those born to HBV-negative women.","25174900"
"Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma-related viral mutations in the post-immunization era.","BACKGROUND: Perinatal infection and immunoprophylaxis failure of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and viral mutations contributes greatly to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known regarding evolution of the HCC-related mutations at early stage of chronic infection.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elucidate dynamic changes of the HCC-related mutations from maternal perinatal transmission to chronic infection in childhood.STUDY DESIGN: A total of 876 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive pregnant women and 95 HBsAg-positive mother-child pairs were included in this study. HBV mutant quasispecies were determined using clone sequencing. Mother-to-child transmission was identified by genotyping and phylogenestic analysis.RESULTS: Univariate regression analysis indicated that maternal HBeAg positivity, viral load =10(6)copies/mL, genotype B2, and male fetus significantly increased the risk of HBV trans-placental transmission. The immunoprophylaxis failure was confirmed in 11 (2.48%) 7-month-old infants. The HCC-risk mutations including A1762T/G1764A were present in the mothers' and cord blood but mostly absent in the 7-month-old infants'. In the 56 mother-child pairs with 1-15 year-old children acquired the infection from their mothers, the frequencies of HBV mutations including A1762T/G1764A and G1896A in genotype B2 or C2 increased consecutively with increasing age of children. These mutations including A1762T/G1764A in genotype C2 and G1896A in genotype B2 were more frequent in mothers than in children (P&lt;0.001). T1753V, C1653T, and G1899A were infrequent in the mother-child pairs.CONCLUSION: Maternally transmitted HBV without the HCC-risk mutations has advantage of infecting infants after the immunization. The HCC-related mutations are sequentially generated since chronic infection established in children.","24973814"

Ages of the children and their vaccination status were obtained from the lady health workers' registers and also verified from the mothers. Five ml of blood was drawn from all the children and their mothers for testing. All sera were tested for anti-hepatitis B. Those found negative were run for HBsAg the sueface antigen and those positive for it were further run for hepatitis B 'e' antigen All tests were run on Abbott machine using chemiluminesence method. EPI-info 12 was used for statistical purposes.RESULTS: A total of 1561 mothers and their 1612 children were tested. Among the mothers, 590 (37.8%) were hepatitis B antibody positive. Remaining 971 (62.2%) samples were tested for surface antigen and 123 (12.7%) were found positive of which 27 (22%) showed HBeAg positivity. Out of 1612 children tested, 975 (60.5%) were positive. Remaining 637 (39.5%) were tested for surface antigen and 49 (8%) were found positive of which 24 (49%) were HBeAg positive with a perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission rate of 5.4% by 12 months of age. Of the 123 surface antigen positive mothers, 18 (14.6%) had children who were also positive, while of the 1489 children born to the 1438 surface antigen negative mothers, 31 (2.1%) were positive. Children born to surface antigen positive mothers had eight times higher risk of getting hepatitis B virus infection and the risk rose to 17 times if the mother was also HBeAg positive. Hepatitis B vaccination record showed that 1229 (76.25%) children were vaccinated at six weeks with pentavalent vaccine, but despite vaccination 33 (2.6%) became surface antigen positive. No vaccination was received by 320 (19.9%) children and out of these 16 (5%) became surface antigen positive. Moreover, the vaccinated and unvaccinated children born to surface antigen positive mothers were nine and 11 times respectively more likely to be exposed to the risk of hepatitis B virus transmission relative to vaccinated children born to surface antigen negative mothers.CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis B vaccination given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of birth is not sufficiently protective, indicating a strong need for the introduction of birth dose into the national immunisation system.","24864633"
"Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.","About 240 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Vertical transmission is the most important mechanism of infection persistence in endemic areas. About 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Mother-to-child transmission of HCV, which occurs in 3-10% of cases, is the leading route of infection in childhood. This review focuses on strategies to reduce the vertical transmission of HBV and HCV. The at-birth prophylaxis of newborns of HBV-infected mothers with specific immunoglobulin and vaccine plus administration of antivirals (tenofovir or telbivudine) in the third trimester of pregnancy (in case of high maternal viral load) greatly reduces the risk of transmission. In contrast, currently there is no drug able to reduce the vertical transmission of HCV infection. We discuss the possibility of reducing mother-to-child HCV transmission using newly available antivirals or antivirals in the pipeline for the treatment of hepatitis C. ","24840817"
"Risk factors associated with immunoprophylaxis failure against mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis B vaccination status in Yunnan province, China.","OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors associated with immunoprophylaxis failure against mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis B vaccination status in Yunnan province, China.METHODS: Multicenter cluster sampling was used to select pregnant women who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HBV immunoprophylaxis was carried out for the newborns. Blood samples were collected and tested for HBV markers from 7 to 10 month old infants. The factors were analyzed by univariate and logistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 2765 mothers and their infants were enrolled. The failure rate of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) was 4.12%. The rate of timely HepB1 vaccination within 24h was 98.04%, the rate of three-dose vaccination was 92.30% and the rate of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) administration was 68.97%. Place of residence, maternal education, gestational age and birth weight were related to administration of HBV immunoprophylaxis. It was remarkable that the rate of HBIG administration of infants was only 63.89% with whose mothers were both HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive. Further analysis showed that there were three risk factors associated with HBV immunoprophylaxis failure: mothers who were positive for HBsAg and HBeAg, maternal HBVDNA level, and HBIG administration or not.CONCLUSIONS: PMTCT of HBV was well implemented in Yunnan. However, in order to achieve optimal prevention of vertical HBV transmission, it is mandatory to make additional efforts to improve the implementation of regulatory HBV immunoprophylaxis, especially for HBsAg-positive pregnant women.","24793939"
"Persistent hepatitis e virus genotype 4 infection in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","INTRODUCTION: In general, the hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute, self-limiting hepatitis. Prolonged and chronic infections caused by HEV genotype 3 have been found in some immunosuppressed patients in developed countries.CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a Chinese boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed hepatitis E during a period of intensive chemotherapy. Twenty months after the initial infection, HEV viremia was reappeared in the patient, with detectable anti-HEV IgM and IgG and modestly elevated serum transaminases. Sequence analysis of the viral RNAs revealed the reactivation of the HEV genotype 4d strain, indicating viral persistence in the patient.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first chronic case confirmed by the prolonged presence of HEV RNA in china. It is also the first reported persistent hepatitis E infection caused by HEV genotype 4.","24596581"
"Impact of maternal hepatitis B virus coinfection on mother-to-child transmission of HIV.","OBJECTIVES: Despite high hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemicity in various resource-limited settings (RLSs), the impact of maternal HIV/HBV coinfection on infant health outcomes has not been defined. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HBV coinfection among HIV-infected pregnant women and its impact on HIV transmission and infant mortality.METHODS: In this study, the seroprevalence of HBV coinfection was determined among HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled in the Six-Week Extended-Dose Nevirapine (SWEN) India trial. The impact of maternal HIV/HBV coinfection on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and infant mortality was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Among 689 HIV-infected pregnant Indian women, 32 (4.6%) had HBV coinfection [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4%, 5.3%]. HBV DNA was detectable in 18 (64%) of 28 HIV/HBV-coinfected women; the median HBV viral load was 155 copies/mL [interquartile range (IQR) &lt; 51-6741 copies/mL]. Maternal HIV/HBV coinfection did not increase HIV transmission risk [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.06; 95% CI 0.30, 3.66; P = 0.93]. Increased odds of all-cause infant mortality was noted (aOR 3.12; 95% CI 0.67, 14.57; P = 0.15), but was not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of active maternal HBV coinfection in HIV-infected pregnant women in India was 4.6%. HIV/HBV coinfection was not independently associated with HIV transmission.","24422893"
"Evaluation of policies and practices to prevent mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus in China: results from China GAVI project final evaluation.","BACKGROUND: Mother to Child Transmission (MTCT) has remained a leading cause of HBV infection in China, accounting for 40% of total infections. Providing hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) to all infants within 24h of birth (Timely Birth Dose, TBD), and subsequent completion of at least 3 vaccine doses is key to preventing perinatal HBV infection. In 2002, with the financial support of the Global Alliance on Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) targeted to Western region and 223 poverty-affected counties in Central region, hepatitis B vaccine was provided for free. In 2010, we evaluated the China GAVI project in terms of its activities to prevent perinatal infections.OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the evaluation were to (1) measure achievements in the China GAVI project in terms of TBD coverage, and (2) describe practices for HBsAg screening of pregnant women and HBIG use outside the GAVI China project.METHODS: We used the methods recommended by WHO to select a cluster sample of health care facilities for the purpose of an injection safety assessment. We stratified China into three regions based on economic criteria, and selected eight counties with a probability proportional to population size in each region. In each selected county, we selected (a) 10 townships at random among the list of townships of the county and (b) the one county level hospital. In each hospital, we abstracted 2002 through 2009 records to collect information regarding birth cohorts, hospitals deliveries, vaccine management, hepatitis B vaccination delivery, HBsAg screening practices and results, and HBIG administration. In addition, in all hospitals, we abstracted records regarding the delivery of TBD.RESULTS: We visited 244 facilities in the three regions, including 24 county hospitals and 220 township hospitals. We reviewed 837,409 birth summary records, 699,249 for infants born at county or township hospitals. Hospital delivery rates increased from 58% in 2002 to 93% in 2009. Surveyed TBD coverage increased from 60% in 2002 to 91% in 2009 (+31%). Surveyed TBD coverage among children born in hospitals increased from 73% in 2002 to 98% in 2009. Between 2002 and 2009, the proportion of pregnant women screened for HBsAg increased from 64% in 2002 to 85% in 2009. In 2009, the proportion of infants born to women screened and found to be HBsAg positive who did not receive any immunization within 24h after birth ranged from 0% to 0.7% across regions.CONCLUSIONS: Increased availability of hepatitis B vaccine, along with efforts to improve hospital deliveries, increased TBD coverage in China. This decreased perinatal HBV transmission and will reduce disease burden in the future. Screening for HBsAg to guide HBIG administration has begun, but with heterogeneous immuno-prophylaxis practices and a poor system for follow up.","24331019"
"Measures to reduce mother-to-child transmission of Hepatitis B virus in China: a meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main mode of spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in China. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the effects of three measures for prevention of MTCT.METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies comparing the index of MTCT among five groups of pregnant women: hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) administration, antiviral treatment, placebo, elective caesarean section, and vaginal delivery.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the incidence of HBV intrauterine infection (RR = 0.42, 95 % CI 0.27-0.64, P &lt; 0.0001) and the number of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infants (RR = 0.44, 95 % CI 0.32-0.61, P &lt; 0.00001) were lower in the HBIG administration group. In the antiviral treatment group, serum HBV DNA levels were lower (MD = -4.01, 95 % CI -5.07 to -2.94, P &lt; 0.00001) at the time of delivery, and normalization of ALT levels was better (RR = 1.11, 95 % CI 1.06-1.17, P &lt; 0.0001). Infant serum HBsAg positivity (RR = 0.45, 95 % CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.03) and incidence of infant HBV transmission RR = 0.06, 95 % CI 0.01-0.24, P &lt; 0.0001) were reduced in antiviral the treatment group. Infant serum anti-HBs positivity at birth (RR = 1.24, 95 % CI 0.89-1.74, P = 0.2) or at 6-7 months (RR = 0.98, 95 % CI 0.86-1.11, P = 0.73) was not significantly different between the caesarean section and vaginal delivery groups. The incidence of infant CHB infection may have been higher in the vaginal delivery group (RR = 2.20, 95 % CI 1.02-4.74, P = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Administration of HBIG or antiviral therapy to HBV carrier mothers during pregnancy is effective in reducing MTCT.","24193353"
"Seroconversion of hepatitis B envelope antigen by entecavir in a child with hepatitis B virus-related membranous nephropathy.","Membranous nephropathy (MN) is caused by subepithelial deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane, with secondary MN arising in association with infection. In secondary MN caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), seroconversion has been known to occur after the onset of MN, particularly in children. In patients with high serum concentrations of HBV DNA, treatment with interferon-a2b or a nucleoside analog has been reported to induce seroconversion and suppress HBV-DNA levels. We treated a 7-year-old boy who presented with proteinuria and liver dysfunction. He had a history of HBV infection since shortly after birth, as his mother was HBV-positive, and he was neither vaccinated nor treated with immunoglobulin at birth. Chronic hepatitis related to HBV was diagnosed following percutaneous needle biopsy of the liver. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed HBV-related glomerulonephritis with diffuse global subepithelial and focal segmental mesangial and subendothelial deposits. Therefore, HBV-associated MN was diagnosed. Treatment with the nucleoside analog lamivudine was started to reduce serum HBV-DNA levels, but lamivudine was discontinued and treatment with entecavir was started at a dosage of 0.5 mg/day after 6 weeks because of possible adverse effects. Tests for HB envelope antibody were positive in week 16 of treatment, and proteinuria had resolved by week 22. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were seen with both treatments but were probably attributable to the developing immune response to HBV. In the present case, HBV levels needed to be reduced to: 1) lower elevated serum HBV-DNA titers, which put the patient at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma; and 2) remove the immune complexes causing MN. Use of nucleoside analogs to suppress the HBV load may facilitate early remission of MN, and entecavir therapy did not cause any serious adverse reactions in this case. Given the advent of lamivudine-resistant HBV, entecavir appears promising for patients with elevated serum levels of HBV DNA. ","24189358"
"Pattern and risk factors for partner infection with hepatitis B virus in a prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is horizontally and vertically transmitted. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality but is preventable with vaccine. There is paucity of data on pattern and risk factors for partner infection in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programmes.OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern and risk factors for partner infection with HBV in a PMTCT Programme.METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serostatus of partners of HBV-infected pregnant women in a PMTCT programme using rapid, third generation immunochromatographic test. Repeatedly reactive samples were confirmed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients' sociodemographic characteristics and behavioral risk factors were evaluated against their HBsAg-serostatus. The seropositive and seronegative subjects had liver function tests HBV vaccination respectively.RESULTS: Out of 3,907 pregnant women seen, 3,762(96.3%) and 73 (45.3%) partners of 161 HBV-infected women were screened. The HBsAg seroprevalence among the women and partners were 161(4.3%) and 5(6.8%) respectively; p&lt;0.43. The sero-concordance and discordance were 6.8% and 93.2% respectively. Nulliparity (60.9%) associated with non-protective pre-marital sex and induced abortions (58.4%), history of blood transfusion (6.7%) and lack of vaccination (93.6%) were risk factors for HBV-infection.CONCLUSION: This study has revealed high prevalence of HBV infection among the couples and high serodiscordance rate. The risk factors for HBV infection were preventable. We recommend integration of couple counseling and testing backed with vaccination into antennal care services nationwide. Further study is required to assess the serostatus of female partners' of HBV-infected males to determine HBV feminization.","23913498"
"Mother-to-Child Transmission of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Among HIV/HCV-Coinfected Women.","BACKGROUND: Maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection has been associated with increased hepatitis C virus (HCV) mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). We hypothesized that HCV/HIV-coinfected women with well-controlled HIV disease would not have increased HCV MTCT.METHODS: The NISDI Perinatal and LILAC cohorts enrolled HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants in Latin America and the Caribbean. This substudy evaluated the HCV infection status of mothers at participating sites and their live born, singleton infants who had a 6-month postnatal visit by December 31, 2008. Mothers who were anti-HCV-positive, or who had CD4 counts (cells/mm(3)) &lt;200 with detectable HCV RNA, were considered HCV-infected. All HCV-infected women were tested for HCV RNA. Infants with HCV RNA were considered HCV-infected.RESULTS: Of 1042 enrolled women, 739 (71%) mother-infant pairs met the inclusion criteria. Of the 739 women, 67 (9%) were anti-HCV-positive and 672 anti-HCV-negative [68 (10%) with CD4 counts &lt;200; of these, 3 (4.4%) were HCV RNA-positive]. Therefore, our study population comprised 70 HCV-infected (47 with HCV RNA) and 669 HCV-uninfected women (and their infants). Factors associated with maternal HCV infection included unemployment (odds ratio [OR] = 2.58); tobacco (OR = 1.73) or marijuana (OR = 3.88) use during pregnancy; enrollment HIV viral load ([VL] copies/mL) =10 000 (OR = 2.27); HIV clinical disease stage C (OR = 2.12); and abnormal alanine aminotransferase (OR = 4.24) or aspartate aminotransferase (OR = 11.98). Four of 47 infants (8.5%) born to HCV-viremic women were HCV-infected, and all 4 mothers had HIV VL &lt;1000 at hospital discharge after delivery.CONCLUSIONS: HCV MTCT among HIV/HCV-coinfected women with well-controlled HIV disease may be lower than reported in other coinfected populations. Studies with longer infant follow-up are needed.","26199724"
"Effect of elective cesarean section on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","BACKGROUND: Many clinicians and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected pregnant women prefer elective caesarean section (ECS) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV, since some studies found higher transmission of HBV in infants born by vaginal delivery (VD) than by cesarean section. However, other studies showed that ECS does not reduce the risk of being infected with HBV in infants. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether ECS may reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HBV.METHODS: Totally 546 children (1-7-year-old) born to 544 HBsAg-positive mothers from 15 cities and rural areas across Jiangsu Province, China, were enrolled. Of these children, 137 (2 pairs of twins) were born to HBeAg-positive mothers; 285 were delivered by ECS and 261 others by VD (one pair of twin in each group). HBV serologic markers were tested by enzyme or microparticle immunoassay.RESULTS: The maternal and gestational ages, maternal HBeAg-positive rates, and children's ages, gender ratios, hepatitis B vaccine coverage and administrations of HBIG were comparable between ECS and VD groups (all p &gt;0.05). The overall prevalence of HBsAg in the 546 children was 2.4%, with 2.5% (7/285) and 2.3% (6/261) in those born by ECS and VD respectively (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.904). Further comparison of chronic HBV infection in the 137 children of HBeAg-positive mothers showed that the HBsAg-positive rates in ECS and VD groups were 10.3% (7/68) and 8.7% (6/69) respectively (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.750), while the mothers had similar HBV DNA levels (2.38<U+2009>×<U+2009>106 vs. 2.35<U+2009>×<U+2009>106 IU/ml, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.586). Additionally, the overall rate of anti-HBs =10 mIU/ml in the children was 71.6%, with 72.3% and 70.9% in those born by ECS and VD respectively (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.717).CONCLUSIONS: With the recommended immunoprophylaxis against hepatitis B, ECS does not reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HBV. Therefore, ECS should not be used in HBsAg-positive pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV.","23706093"
"Breast feeding and immunoprophylaxis efficacy of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to explore if hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be transmitted via breast milk through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), and assay the immunoprophylaxis efficacy after passive-active immunization.METHOD: From year 2008 to 2012, 67,720 pregnant women were screened and 1186 HBsAg-carrier mothers and their infants aged 8-12 months were followed in multi-centers of China, among whom HBV markers (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb and HBcAb) and HBV-DNA were measured.RESULTS: HBsAg positive rate of pregnant women was 6.7% (4533/67,720) and infants' immunoprophylaxis failure rate was 3.3% (39/1186). Immunoprophylaxis failure infants were all born to mothers of HBeAg positive and HBV-DNA &gt;6 log10 copies/ml. Among infants of HBeAg positive mothers, HBV infection rate was 9.0% and HBsAg positive rate was 8.3% in breast-feeding group versus 9.2% in formula-feeding group, P=0.761. Occurrence of perinatal HBV infection was indicated in uterus or during delivery. Different feeding patterns had no effects on HBsAb conversion of infants with the implementation of immunization.CONCLUSIONS: HBsAg prevalence rate of pregnant women enrolled was 6.7% and immunoprophylaxis failure rate of infants was 3.3%, while the infection rate reached 9.0% in infants of HBeAg positive mothers. Breast feeding did not increase the occurrence of HBV MTCT.","23682864"
"A knowledge survey of obstetrics and gynecology staff on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","INTRODUCTION: This survey was designed to investigate the knowledge awareness of obstetrics and gynaecology staff (Obs/Gyn staff) on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV).METHODOLOGY: Obs/Gyn staff from 21 of the 31 Chinese mainland provinces, who attended medical meetings or training classes from July to October 2011, were invited to complete a questionnaire regarding PMTCT of HBV. The questionnaire included the clinical implications of HBV serologic markers and PMTCT preventive measures for both pregnant women and infants.RESULTS: A total of 828 questionnaires were distributed, 617 (74.5%) Obs/Gyn staff participated in the survey, and 559 (90.6%) questionnaires met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 90% of participants correctly determined the positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as infectious, but up to 27.5% mistakenly considered the presence of anti-HBe and/or anti-HBc with negative HBsAg as infectious. In total, 96.3% respondents knew that pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection, and 95.3% realized that infants of HBsAg-positive mothers should be injected with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and vaccine. On the other hand, with the available immunoprophylaxis, 13.8% participants mistakenly believed caesarean section may prevent HBV mother-to-child transmission, and only 13% correctly answered that newborns of HBsAg positive mothers may be breastfed.CONCLUSION: Obs/Gyn staff in China have mastered the strategies of HBV PMTCT, but there is obvious insufficiency in details of the application. Intensified efforts to train the Obs/Gyn staff are required to improve the current suboptimal medical service in HBV-exposed infants and to control mother-to-infant transmission of HBV.","23669428"

"Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) during pregnancy and the puerperium: current standards of care.","BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus continues to occur despite the interventions of hepatitis B vaccination and immunoglobulin. The most significant risk factor in transmission is high maternal viral load. Being aware of viral replicative activity permits risk stratification and allows the opportunity for additional preventative measures such as antiviral therapy.METHODS: Retrospective audit of investigations and clinical management among hepatitis B surface antigen-positive pregnant women from three maternity services across Victoria over a five-year period from 2006 to 2011.RESULTS: Over the study period at the three institutions, there were 46,855 births, and 398 hepatitis B-positive pregnant women. 87% of the women were non-Australian-born. Viral load testing was performed in &lt;20% of all pregnancies, and hepatitis B e antigen status assessed in 33%. Only 18% of the women with hepatitis B were referred for specialist care, but if referred, they were more likely to have an assessment of viral replicative status performed. Compliance with administration of neonatal hepatitis B immunoglobulin and birth-dose vaccination was high (&gt;90%).CONCLUSION: There is scope for considerable improvement in referral and assessment of pregnant women with hepatitis B infection. Guidelines addressing the issue of maternal viral replicative status and the need for antiviral therapy may assist in guiding clinical management.","23452292"
"Breastfeeding is not a risk factor for mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","BACKGROUND: Many clinicians do not encourage breastfeeding in hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, since HBV DNA can be detected in breast milk and breast lesions may increase exposure of infants to HBV. The aim of this study was to determine whether breastfeeding may add risk for perinatal HBV transmission.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Totally 546 children (1-7-year-old) of 544 HBV-infected mothers were investigated, with 397 breastfed and 149 formula-fed; 137 were born to HBeAg-positive mothers. All children had been vaccinated against hepatitis B but only 53.3% received hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). The overall prevalence of HBsAg+, HBsAg-/anti-HBc+, and anti-HBs (=10 mIU/ml) in children was 2.4%, 3.1%, and 71.6% respectively. The HBsAg prevalence in breast- and formula-fed children was 1.5% and 4.7% respectively (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.063); the difference was likely due to the higher mothers' HBeAg-positive rate in formula-fed group (formula-fed 49.0% vs. breastfed 15.9%, P&lt;0.001). Further logistic regression analyses showed that breastfeeding was not associated with the HBV infection in the children, adjusting for the effect of maternal HBeAg status and other factors different between the two groups.SIGNIFICANCE: Under the recommended prophylaxis, breastfeeding is not a risk factor for mother-to-child transmission of HBV. Therefore, clinicians should encourage HBV-infected mothers to breastfeed their infants.","23383145"
"[Efficacy and safety of telbivudine treatment to block mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: a meta-analysis].","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of telbivudine treatment in pregnant patients with chronic hepatitis B to block mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV).METHODS: Medline and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were searched for studies of HBV, mother-to-child transmission, and telbivudine. Of the 68 potentially relevant publications, eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conformed to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following data extraction, a meta-analysis was carried out with RevMan5.1 software.RESULTS: Seven of the eight RCTs were in Chinese, and the remaining study was in English but carried out at a Chinese site. The RCTs comprised a total of 678 subjects, including 352 cases and 326 controls. Infants born to telbivudine-treated mothers had a significantly lower rate of HBsAg positivity and HBV DNA positivity at birth than the control group of infants (odds ratio (OR) = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.43, P less than 0.00001; OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.32, P less than 0.00001). Infants born to telbivudine-treated mothers also had significantly lower rates of mother-to-child transmitted HBV at 6 months (OR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.22, P less than 0.00001; OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.25, P = 0.0003) and 12 months (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.56, P = 0.007; OR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.37, P = 0.001) after birth. The pre-telbivudine treatment levels of HBV DNA were not significantly different between pregnant women in the telbivudine-treated group and the control group (OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.24, P = 0.04), but the HBV DNA levels were significantly lower in the telbivudine-treated group of pregnant women prior to delivery (OR = -3.92, 95% CI: -4.90, -2.95, P less than 0.00001). There was no evidence of telbivudine treatment being associated with more adverse side effects or complications during pregnancy or in the infant (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 0.68, 4.38, P = 0.25; OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.04, 11.24, P = 0.80).CONCLUSION: Telbivudine treatment effectively and safely prevents mother-to-child transmission of HBV from chronically infected mothers with a high degree of infectivity late in pregnancy.","23207336"
"Hepatitis C virus clearance after discontinuation of pegylated interferon alpha-2a monotherapy in a child.","The present patient was a 4-year-old boy. His hepatitis C virus genotype was 2a, and his viral load was high (1400,000<U+2009>U/mL). The pretreatment liver biopsy revealed no fibrosis or malignancy and mild chronic hepatitis; his Knodell's histological activity (HAI) score was 4. Single nucleotide polymorphism of IL28B (rs8099917) was major type. The patient began antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2a (90<U+2009>µg/week). At week 9, serum HCV RNA became undetectable, with a sensitivity of 50<U+2009>copies/mL. Antiviral treatment was discontinued at week 11 because the ALT level increased to 610<U+2009>U/L. After discontinuation of therapy, the patient's serum HCV RNA status became positive again. The serum viral load increased to 100,000<U+2009>U/mL. During this period, he had been observed without medication. Sixteen months after stopping treatment, serum HCV became undetectable. Over a 4-year period, HCV RNA became negative and his anti-HCV antibody titer gradually decreased. In conclusion, though antiviral therapy resulted in failure or incomplete therapy, a reduced viral load resulted in viral clearance in the present patient. Interleukin 28B genotype might have association with the clearance of hepatitis C virus after discontinuation of antiviral therapy.","23118765"

"Hepatitis C virus infection in a child with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2: a case report.","INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 is a rare disorder. Its prevalence in western populations has been reported as 1.5 to 4.5/100,000. On the other hand, its prevalence in Egypt is unknown. It is characterized by the association of autoimmune Addison's disease with thyroid autoimmune diseases and/or type I diabetes mellitus. Hepatitis C virus infection is an important public health issue worldwide. Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection of any country in the world. It is estimated to be 8% in urban and 25% in rural areas. We present the case of an Egyptian child with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 associated with chronic hepatitis C infection.CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Egyptian boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus was referred to our institution for an evaluation of recurrent attacks of hypoglycemia of two months duration. The initial clinical examination revealed hypotension as well as vitiligo of the skin. He had high potassium, low sodium, low cortisol, high adrenocorticotropic hormone, slightly high thyroid stimulating levels with strong positivity of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. The hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus-polymerase chain reaction were positive. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 with chronic hepatitis C was made. He was started on hydrocortisone (10mg twice daily), fludrocortisone (0.1mg twice daily) and multiple daily doses of insulin. He showed great<U+2009>improvement of his symptoms on the prescribed treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The importance of the early diagnosis of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 and the possibility of its association with chronic hepatitis C infection should be considered in order to implement the proper management of such cases.","22839422"
"Genetic variants associated with susceptibility to mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms of immune tolerance to hepatitis B virus (HBV) in children infected perinatally or early in infancy still remain unclarified. We aimed to study the genetic variants of immune factors implicated in viral-host interaction in children who were born to HBV-positive mothers and who had different clinical outcome.METHODS: Mannose-binding lectin gene (mbl2) codon 54, codon 57, and promoter 221 variants, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) 308G/A, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) ApaI and TaqI genotypes were analyzed in three groups of children born to HBV-positive mothers: children with chronic infection (n=33), those with resolved infection (n=36), and those naive for HBV (n=33).RESULTS: TNF-a -308G allele frequency was found to be increased in children with chronic infection compared with children who were not affected by HBV [risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-1.25; P=0.050]. The VDR ApaI A allele tended to be more frequent in children with chronic infection than in those with resolved HBV infection (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.95-1.67; P=0.071). The VDR ApaI a allele in ApaI and TaqI joint haplotype aT was more frequent in children with resolved infection than in those with chronic infection (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.97-3.13; P=0.049).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TNF-a and vitamin D pathways may be involved in the susceptibility to and outcome of HBV infection acquired early in life.","22772094"
"Simultaneous triple point-of-care testing for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus to prevent mother-to-child transmission in India.","An innovative simultaneous triple point-of-care (STPOC) screening strategy for syphilis, hepatitis B and HIV with Determine(®) tests was offered to pregnant women presenting for antenatal care and evaluated for feasibility and preference in rural India. Of 1066 participants approached, 1046 consented, of which 1002 (96.0%) completed the strategy. Only 9% reported any history of testing in their current pregnancy. With STPOC screening, 989 women (98.7%) tested negative and 13 had preliminary positive results for infection. The total time taken was 45 minutes per participant. Mothers and infants were provided prophylaxis/treatment for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B, with interventions initiated within 3-5 days. STPOC was preferred by 99.3% (95%CI: 98.8-99.8%) of participants, facilitated early simultaneous screening for the three infections, timely initiation of prophylaxis/treatment and was feasible in this rural setting. These data suggest that multiplexed STPOC screening for syphilis, hepatitis B and HIV in pregnancy would be desirable for women in rural India.","22648884"

"Risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus: Maternal high viral load and fetal exposure in the birth canal.","AIM:   Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the major transmission pathway of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in children. However, its risk factors remain unsettled for introduction of putative intervention.METHODS:   Pregnant women screened for HCV and MTCT in children born to antibody-positive mothers were prospectively studied in Tottori, Japan.RESULTS:   Among 41 856 screened women, 188 (0.45%) were HCV antibody-positive, of whom 61% had detectable HCV RNA. While 10 of the 34 children (29%) born to high viral load (HVL: =6.0 × 10(5)  IU/mL) mothers were infected, none born to RNA-detectable but non-HVL mothers were infected (P &lt; 0.001). MTCT among vaginally delivered children born to HVL mothers was analyzed. Children delivered after 4 h or more of labor were more frequently infected than were those born within 4 h of labor (P = 0.019). Premature rupture of fetal membranes was significantly more common in infected children than in uninfected children (P &lt; 0.001). Durations of membrane rupture and labor were longer in infected children than in uninfected children (P = 0.008 and P = 0.040, respectively). Elective cesarean section that eliminates these risk factors, other than HVL, significantly reduced MTCT from nine of 22 (41%) to none of nine children (0%) (P = 0.032).CONCLUSION:   Our data suggest that contamination of the fetus in the birth canal with infected maternal blood is a major risk factor for HCV MTCT, in addition to maternal HVL. To rationalize intervention by elective cesarean section, the natural history of infected children should be carefully evaluated.","22404371"

"A meta-analysis of lamivudine for interruption of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","AIM: To determine the therapeutic effect of lamivudine in late pregnancy for the interruption of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV).METHODS: Studies were identified by searching available databases up to January 2011. Inclusive criteria were HBV-carrier mothers who had been involved in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with lamivudine treatment in late pregnancy, and newborns or infants whose serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) or HBV DNA had been documented. The relative risks (RRs) for interruption of MTCT as indicated by HBsAg, HBV DNA or HBeAg of newborns or infants were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the efficacy of lamivudine treatment.RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs including 1693 HBV-carrier mothers were included in this meta-analysis. The overall RR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25-0.76; 8 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.04) and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.23-0.47; 6 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.93) indicated by newborn HBsAg or HBV DNA. The RR was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.50; 6 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.46) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.20-0.50; 4 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.33) indicated by serum HBsAg or HBV DNA of infants 6-12 mo after birth. The RR (lamivudine vs hepatitis B immunoglobulin) was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.16-0.46; 5 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.94) and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.07-0.79; 3 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.60) indicated by newborn HBsAg or HBV DNA, respectively. In the mothers with viral load &lt; 106 copies/mL after lamivudine treatment, the efficacy (RR, 95% CI) was 0.33, 0.21-0.53 (5 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.82) for the interruption of MTCT, however, this value was not significant if maternal viral load was &gt; 106 copies/mL after lamivudine treatment (P = 0.45, 2 RCTs), as indicated by newborn serum HBsAg. The RR (lamivudine initiated from 28 wk of gestation vs control) was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.22-0.52; 7 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.92) and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.22-0.50; 5 RCTs; P(heterogeneity) = 0.86) indicated by newborn HBsAg or HBV DNA. The incidence of adverse effects of lamivudine was not higher in the mothers than in controls (P = 0.97). Only one study reported side effects of lamivudine in newborns.CONCLUSION: Lamivudine treatment in HBV carrier-mothers from 28 wk of gestation may interrupt MTCT of HBV efficiently. Lamivudine is safe and more efficient than hepatitis B immunoglobulin in interrupting MTCT. HBV MTCT might be interrupted efficiently if maternal viral load is reduced to &lt; 106 copies/mL by lamivudine treatment.","22090789"
"An algorithm for risk assessment and intervention of mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Despite immunoprophylaxis, mother to child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) still occurs in infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers. We analyzed methods of risk assessment and interventions for MTCT.METHODS: We reviewed 63 articles and abstracts published from 1975-2011 that were relevant to MTCT; articles were identified using the PubMed bibliographic database.RESULTS: Administration of HB immunoglobulin and HB vaccine to infants at birth (within 12 hours), followed by 2 additional doses of vaccines within 6-12 months, prevented approximately 95% of HBV transmission from HBsAg-positive mothers to their infants. However, HBV was still transmitted from 8%-30% of mothers with high levels of viremia. It is important to assess the risk for MTCT and identify mothers who are the best candidates for intervention. The most important risk factor is maternal level of HBV DNA &gt;200,000 IU (10(6) copies)/mL; other factors include a positive test result for the HB e antigen, pregnancy complications such as threatened preterm labor or prolonged labor, and failure of immunoprophylaxis in prior children. Antiviral therapy during late stages of pregnancy is the most effective method to reduce transmission from mothers with high levels of viremia, but elective cesarean section might also be effective. Antepartum administration of HB immunoglobulin, giving infants a double dose of HB vaccine, or avoiding breastfeeding had no impact on MTCT.CONCLUSIONS: HBsAg-positive mothers should be assessed for risk of MTCT, and infants should receive immunoprophylaxis. Pregnant women with levels of HBV DNA &gt;200,000 IU/mL should be considered for strategies to reduce the risk for MTCT. We propose an algorithm for risk assessment and patient management that is based on a review of the literature and the opinion of a panel of physicians with expertise in preventing MTCT.","22079509"

"First report of an autochthonous hepatitis E virus genotype 3 infection in a 5 month old female child in Germany.","Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is well-known to cause endemic outbreaks of hepatitis in tropical countries, mostly caused by HEV genotypes 1 or 2 and transmitted from humans to humans via the fecal-oral route. In contrast, HEV genotypes 3 or 4 are commonly encountered as sporadic cases in a non-endemic setting; these autochthonous cases are transmitted from animals to humans and commonly affect elderly male subjects. We report a five-month-old caucasian girl presenting with diarrhea, emesis, and elevated ALT. Surprisingly, acute infection with Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 was laboratory-confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Thirteen months later, RT-PCR for HEV from stool tested negative whereas anti-HEV IgG in serum tested positive. Neither HEV RNA nor anti-HEV antibodies could be detected in stool or serum of the parents. To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case of a HEV infection in Germany. Thus, HEV should be included into the differential diagnosis of pediatric infectious liver and bowel disease.","21084220"

"Cellular immunity in children with successful immunoprophylactic treatment for mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","BACKGROUND: The administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin followed by hepatitis B vaccine can result in a protective efficacy of almost 90% in mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, little is known about immunity against HBV infection in children after immunoprophylactic treatment. We tried to assess the association between T-cell responses and viremia in children after successful prophylactic treatment.METHODS: Thirteen children and their 8 HBV carrier mothers (8 families), who were positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24, were enrolled in this study. All of the 13 children received immunoprophylactic treatment and became negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) after birth. HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were evaluated using IFNgamma - enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and major histocompatibility complex class I peptide pentamer assays. Serum HBV DNA was measured by real-time PCR.RESULTS: Significant HBV-specific T-cell responses were detected in 2 (15%) of the 13 children by ELISPOT. However, the frequency of HLA-A24-HBV-specific CTLs was very low in both HBV carrier mothers and children using pentamers. Of the 13 children, 4 (31%) were positive for serum HBV DNA. However, the levels of serum HBV DNA were 100 copies/ml or less. One of the 2 children in whom significant HBV-specific CTL responses were detectable was positive for serum HBV DNA.CONCLUSIONS: HBV core and polymerase-specific T-cell responses were detected and a low-dose viremia was observed in children after successful immunoprophylaxis treatment. Although the presence of viremia was not related to HBV-specific T-cell responses, CTLs might play a role in the control of HBV infection in children born to HBsAg-positive mothers after immunoprophylactic treatment.","20423521"
"Sustained virologic response prevents the development of esophageal varices in compensated, Child-Pugh class A hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhosis. A 12-year prospective follow-up study.","The incidence of de novo development of esophageal varices (EV) in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis has been determined by few studies in the short term and never in the long term. The aims of the present study were to determine the incidence and the risk factors associated with the development of EV and to assess whether antiviral treatment and achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR) may prevent de novo EV development in patients with HCV-induced cirrhosis. We studied 218 patients with compensated EV-free, HCV-induced cirrhosis consecutively enrolled between 1989 and 1992 at three referral centers in Milan, Italy. Endoscopic surveillance was performed at 3-year intervals according to international guidelines. SVR was defined as undetectable serum HCV-RNA 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation. During a median follow-up of 11.4 years, 149/218 (68%) patients received antiviral treatment and 34 (22.8%) achieved SVR.

"Hepatitis B immunoglobulin injection in pregnancy to interrupt hepatitis B virus mother-to-child transmission-a meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) during pregnancy to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) mother-to-child transmission (MTCT).METHODS: We systematically reviewed the effect of HBIG in decreasing HBV MTCT from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) carried out between January 1990 and December 2008, in English and Chinese languages. Multiple databases were searched, and experts in this field were contacted. The methodological quality of each RCT was assessed by the Jadad score. We abstracted data on HBV intrauterine infection, MTCT, treatment methods, newborn immune prophylaxis methods, and adverse effects. A Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model was employed for all analyses using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).RESULTS: Five thousand nine hundred newborns of asymptomatic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive mothers from 37 qualified RCTs were included. Compared with the control group, newborns in the HBIG group had a lower intrauterine infection rate (indicated by HBsAg as OR 0.22, 95% CI [0.17, 0.29], from 32 RCTs; indicated by HBV DNA as OR 0.15, 95% CI [0.07, 0.30], from 13 RCTs; p&lt;0.01 for both) and a higher protection rate (indicated by hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) as OR 11.79, 95% CI [4.69, 29.61], from 15 RCTs; p&lt;0.01).

"Transmission of hepatitis C virus infection from asymptomatic mother to child in southern India.","BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in India, and no interventions to decrease transmission rates have been identified. Hence, we performed a long-term prospective study in infants born to HCV-positive mothers, with the aim of evaluating vertical transmission of HCV and correlated risks factors.METHODS: Three thousand one hundred and fifteen healthy asymptomatic pregnant women were included in the study. We used third-generation (Murex anti-HCV) ELISA and HCV RNA reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for screening, and the commercial line probe assay (Inno-LiPA) and direct sequencing HCV genotyping assays were performed to confirm the transmitted HCV genotypes.RESULTS: Of the total 3115 healthy asymptomatic pregnant women, 18 (0.6%) were positive for anti-HCV. Of the 18 anti-HCV-positive women, eight (44.4%) were positive for HCV RNA RT-PCR. HCV transmission was observed in two of the eight babies born to eight HCV RNA-positive mothers who were followed up for 12 months. HCV genotyping of the mother/child pairs revealed the persistent presence of mixed genotypes 1a and 4 throughout the follow-up period. None of the non-viremic (HCV RNA-negative) mothers transmitted HCV infection to their baby. In our study approximately 25% of vertical/perinatal transmission of HCV was observed among HCV RNA-positive antenatal women.CONCLUSIONS: This study is of importance as it is the first report from India of a successful attempt to analyze the rate of vertical/perinatal transmission of HCV from infected mothers to their children by a prospective longitudinal follow-up study, and to characterize the pattern of genotype(s) of HCV present in the infected mother/baby pairs, so as to confirm the source of HCV acquired by the newborn babies.","19376736"
"Elective caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preventing mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus--a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Caesarean section before labor or before ruptured membranes (&quot;elective caesarean section&quot;, or ECS) has been introduced as an intervention for preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, no evidence that ECS versus vaginal delivery reduces the rate of MTCT of HBV has been generally provided. The aim of this review is to assess, from randomized control trails (RCTs), the efficacy and safety of ECS versus vaginal delivery in preventing mother-to-child HBV transmission.RESULTS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January, 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library 2008, issue 1), PubMed (1950 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1975 to 2008), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 2008), VIP database (1989 to 2008), as well as reference lists of relevant studies. Finally, four randomized trails involving 789 people were included. Based on meta-analysis, There was strong evidence that ECS versus vaginal delivery could effectively reduce the rate of MTCT of HBV (ECS: 10.5%; vaginal delivery: 28.0%). The difference between the two groups (ECS versus vaginal delivery) had statistical significance (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.60, P &lt; 0.000001). No data regarding maternal morbidity or infant morbidity according to mode of delivery were available.CONCLUSION: ECS appears to be effective in preventing MTCT of HBV and no postpartum morbidity (PPM) was reported. However, the conclusions of this review must be considered with great caution due to high risk of bias in each included study (graded C).","18755018"
"Pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection in patients with Child-Pugh Class A liver cirrhosis.","OBJECTIVE: Pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) treatment is less effective in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and liver cirrhosis than in non-cirrhotic patients. Many patients with advanced liver disease have been excluded from the pivotal randomized controlled studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy in unselected patients with Child-Pugh Class A liver cirrhosis at a Swedish university clinic.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The virologic response and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed in 104 patients with HCV-associated Child-Pugh Class A liver cirrhosis who had been treated with peg-IFN and RBV.RESULTS: Overall sustained virologic response (SVR) was achieved in 13% genotype 1-, 60% genotype 2-, and 31% genotype 3-infected patients. In treatment-naive patients, the corresponding rates were 13%, 82%, and 38%, respectively. In 46% of patients, treatment was discontinued prematurely owing to lack of virologic response in the majority.CONCLUSIONS: SVR rates found in our study, in particular for genotype 1 patients (13%), were lower than those generally found in randomized controlled studies. For cirrhotic patients, new treatment alternatives are urgently needed to improve treatment outcome.","18615358"

Thus, 379 pregnant women attending ante-natal consultation in Saint Camille Medical Centre were subject to HIV, HHV-8 antibodies and the viral marker Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) detection. We observed 48/379 (12.66%) HIV seropositive subjects. Among them, HIV-1 type infection was predominant (95.83%), only 2/48 (4.17%) subjects had a dual HIV-1 type and HIV-2 type infection, no single HIV-2 type infection was detected. 38/379 (10.02%) subjects were infected by HHV-8 and 30/379 (7.91%) were HBsAg positive. HHV-8 and HIV Co-infections rates were high within HBV positive patients and we had respectively 20.00 and 16.67%. 10.42% HIV positive women were coinfected by HBV while 12.50% were infected by HHV-8. Then, 15.79% subjects HHV-8 positive were co-infected by HBV or HIV. In spite of the PMTCT protocol application, five (10.42%) HIV positive women transmitted the virus to their children. Two HIV positive mothers were co-infected by HHV-8 and one by HBV. Among the 5 HIV infected, one mother (20.0%) was HBV positive and two (40.0%) HHV-8 positive. Although we did not have a large sample which would show large prélalences of the infections, we could put forward that the Co-infection of the HIV with one of these viruses (HBV or HHV-8) could favorite the mother-to-child transmission.","19090184"

The present study evaluated the prevalence of the HCV infection in the general population and the incidence of vertical transmission, from women who delivered in the Obstetric Clinic of the Hospital of Parma from January 1st 1996 to 31st 2001 December.METHODS: Mothers and children were tested for the presence of HCV-RNA within one week after delivery. Children were considered to be infected when they were found positive at least twice for viral RNA or antibodies were still detectable at the end of the follow-up period (18 months) in blood.RESULTS: Out of 13,025 women, 110 (0.8%) were found positive for anti-HCV antibodies; 72 of them (65.4%) were HCV-RNA positive. All 110 children were positive for anti-HCV antibodies in the first blood sample (time 0); 8 of them were HCV-RNA positive. Three children were still viremic at the end of the follow-up whereas 5 showed a clearance. No significant differences were found between viremic and nonviremic children with respect to gestational week, maternal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and newborns weight at birth.CONCLUSION: This investigation shows that vertical transmission may occur in a general obstetric population despite a low prevalence of HCV-positive subjects.","17713138"
"HCV/HIV co-infection, HCV viral load and mode of delivery: risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus?","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in children is mainly acquired via maternal transmission. Our aim was to identify mother-to-child-transmission (MTC) risk factors, namely those associated with maternal virological characteristics and mode of delivery.METHODS: Women were included between October 1998 and September 2002 in six hospitals in Southern France on the basis of positive HCV serological status. Recorded data included maternal characteristics, circumstances of delivery and laboratory data concerning mother and child. Paediatric follow-up lasted 1 year, and 2 years for children with circulating HCV RNA.RESULTS: A total of 214 mother-and-child pairs were analysed; 55 (26%) were HCV/HIV co-infected. The probability of HCV transmission was three-fold higher for HCV/HIV-co-infected women (P = 0.05). Twelve children were HCV RNA positive at 1 year of age (MTC = 5.6%); three became HCV RNA negative between 12 (M12) and 18 months of age (M18) and recovered normal alanine aminotransferase levels. Circulating HCV RNA was found in 137 (69%) mothers. Mothers of infected children all displayed HCV viraemia (MTC = 8.8%): six children were born of HCV/HIV-co-infected HCV RNA positive women (MTC = 13.6%) and six from HCV monoinfected women with positive HCV RNA (MTC = 6.5%). When maternal HCV RNA levels were below 6 log-IU/ml, the rate of transmission was significantly higher in the case of HCV/HIV co-infection (odds ratio = 8.3, 95% confidence interval, 1.4-47.5) P = 0.01. This association did not, however, exist for HCV RNA-positive mothers with levels of at least 6 log-IU/ml. Rate of transmission did not differ significantly between children born by vaginal delivery or caesarean section after membrane rupture and those born by elective caesarean section independently of HIV status.","17690581"
"Re-evaluation of the true rate of hepatitis C virus mother-to-child transmission and its novel risk factors based on our two prospective studies.","OBJECTIVE: To re-evaluate the true hepatitis C virus (HCV) mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate and its novel risk factors.STUDY DESIGN: A comparative study based on our own two prospective studies done during the two periods, 'early' (1989-1994) and 'recent' (1995-2004).RESULTS: All carrier infants became HCV RNA-positive within 3 months after birth. The MTCT and de-carrier rates were, respectively, higher (14.2%) and lower (16.7%) in the recent period, although liver dysfunction of carrier infants was found very frequently (66.7%) in both groups. MTCT occurred significantly when the maternal viral load, serum alanine aminotransferase (sALT) levels and blood loss at delivery were, respectively, more than 10(5) copies/mL, 110 IU/L, and 500 g. No MTCT was found when elective cesarean section was done.CONCLUSIONS: The true HCV MTCT and de-carrier rates were found to be much higher and lower than those reported previously. The maternal liver dysfunction (sALT &gt;or=110 IU/mL) and blood loss (&gt;or=500 g) at delivery are the next risk factors to maternal viral load (&gt;or=10(5) copies/mL) for MTCT.","17688606"
"Molecular evidence of father-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus.","At present in Japan, only high-risk infants born to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected mothers are given HBV vaccine. However, children can contract the virus from other HBV-infected family members, including fathers. The aim of this study is to present substantial and unequivocal evidence of father-to-child transmission of HBV infection using techniques including homology analysis and phylogenetic analysis. Thirteen chronic HBV-infected members of five families that included eight children and their respective fathers were enrolled in this study. Homology analysis and phylogenetic analyses of 2 coding region, the S gene and X gene, from the HBV genome were performed comparing the 13 nucleotide sequences from the 13 subjects. The nucleotide homology among the five sets of fathers and children was quite high (99.3-100%). A phylogenetic tree constructed on the 13 nucleotide sequences showed that all 5 sets of fathers and children were grouped into the same cluster with high bootstrap values. These results strongly indicate that father-to-child transmission is an important route of HBV infection in Japan and it is recommend that universal vaccination against HBV infection be instituted immediately in Japan for all children, in accordance with the WHO recommendation of 1997.","17516534"

"Early infection and asymptomatic spread of hepatitis A virus in a public child care center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: should attending children under two years of age be vaccinated?","A cross-sectional study was conducted in order to identify hepatitis A virus (HAV) serological markers in 418 individuals (mean age, 16.4 years; range, 1 month-80 years) at a public child care center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as well as to analyze risk factors and determine circulating genotypes. Serum samples were tested using an enzyme immunoassay. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and characterize HAV RNA, and sequencing was performed. Anti-HAV antibodies and IgM anti-HAV antibodies were detected, respectively, in 89.5% (374/418) and 10.5% (44/418) of the individuals tested. Acute HAV infection in children was independently correlated with crawling (p &lt; 0.05). In 56.8% (25/44) of the IgM anti-HAV-positive individuals and in 33.3% (5/15) of the IgM anti-HAV-negative individuals presenting clinical symptoms, HAV RNA was detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed co-circulation of subgenotypes IA and IB in 93.3% (28/30) of the amplified samples. In present study, we verify that 79% (30/38) of children IgM anti-HAV-positive were asymptomatic. In child care centers, this asymptomatic spread is a more serious problem, promoting the infection of young children, who rarely show signs of infection. Therefore, vaccinating children below the age of two might prevent the asymptomatic spread of hepatitis A.","16951811"
"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels in hepatitis B virus-related chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and its relationship to Knodell and Child-Pugh scores.","Although both chronic active hepatitis-B (CAH-B) and liver cirrhosis (LC) are characterised by various degrees of inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis, in advanced stage cirrhosis, marked fibrosis develops and inflammation and tissue necrosis diminishes. In this study, we aimed to investigate serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentration in patients with CAH-B and LC and its relationship to disease activity. Serum samples were taken from 30 patients with CAH-B and 30 with LC at different stages of the disease. TNF-alpha concentrations were measured by the ELISA technique. Results were compared with those of 30 healthy controls. Mean plasma TNF-alpha levels were found as 2.47 +/- 2.98, 0.8 +/- 1.21 and 0.72 +/- 1.08 pg/ml in CAH-B, LC and control groups, respectively. TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in CAH-B group than LC and control groups (p &lt;0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Although mean plasma TNF-alpha level of cirrhotic patients at Child-A stage was markedly high (3.31 +/- 0.15), no significant difference has been found between LC and control groups (p &gt; 0.05). TNF-alpha concentrations were positively correlated with hepatitis activity index (Knodell's score) in CAH-B group whereas negatively correlated with Child-Pugh score in LC group (r =0.73, p &lt; 0.01 and r = -0.42, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Our study showed that TNF-alpha level increases in patients with CAH-B correlated with histologic activity index. So it can be used to evaluate disease activity. Additionally, marked reduction of TNF-alpha concentration in advanced cirrhosis suggested that TNF-alpha production is determined by hepatic damage and inflammation.","16939549"
"[Prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infection in pregnant women and mother-child transmission in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso].","The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) among pregnant women and the rate of mother-child transmission. Over one month (April 26 to May 25, 2002) blood samples of 200 pregnant women who gave birth at the maternity of the university hospital and Gounguin center medical of Ouagadougou were tested for anti-HVC antibodies (Ac HCV) and anti HIV antibodies (Ac HIV). Infants born to mother tested positive for Ac HCV and their mother were tested for HCV-RNA. The prevalence of HCV (positive Ac HCV and HCV-RNA) was 2% in pregnant women (4/200). One case of mother-child transmission was found. The virus transmitted was 2a (A/C) genotype. The mother had a high titre of HCV-ARN, was co-infected by HIV and had had history of blood transfusion, excision and tattoo of the gums.","16821441"
"Natural history of compensated cirrhosis in the Child-Pugh class A compared between 490 patients with hepatitis C and 167 with B virus infections.","Natural histories of compensated cirrhosis in the Child-Pugh class A were compared between the 490 patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 167 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) who were followed for more than 1 year up to 20 years without antiviral treatment. Patients with HCV were older (median age: 59 vs. 45 years), less predominantly male (59.0% vs. 76.0%), transfused more frequently (49.2% vs. 9.0%), and had higher aminotransferase as well as lower albumin levels and fewer platelets (P &lt; 0.001 for all). Death was commoner (55.1% vs. 35.9%, P &lt; 0.001) and hepatocellular carcinoma developed more often (53.9% vs. 28.7%, P &lt; 0.001) in patients with HCV than HBV. In multivariate analysis, low albumin levels (hazard ratio: 1.65), alpha-fetoprotein (1.55), alcohol consumption (1.49), age &gt;55 years (1.47), and retention of indocyanine green (1.39) were independent risk factors for the survival in patients with HCV, while male gender (4.43), age &gt;45 years (2.24), retention of indocyanine green (2.14), hepatitis B e antigen (2.11), and low platelet counts (1.91) were in those with HBV. Chances for survival was significantly different (P &lt; 0.001) among patients with HCV having low (number of factors: 0-1), medium (2-3), and high risks (4-5), as well as in those with HBV having low (0-1), medium (2-4), and high risks (5-6). In conclusion, survival and development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and factors for survival, are considerably different between patients with compensated cirrhosis infected with HCV and HBV, which would need to be taken into consideration in their management and planning treatment strategies.","16482557"
"A significant sex--but not elective cesarean section--effect on mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus infection.","BACKGROUND: Risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are poorly quantified.METHODS: We conducted a European multicenter prospective study of HCV-infected pregnant women and their infants. Children with &gt; or =2 positive HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction test results and/or anti-HCV antibodies after 18 months of age were considered to be infected.RESULTS: The overall HCV vertical transmission rate was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0%-7.5%; 91/1479). Girls were twice as likely to be infected as boys (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.07 [95% CI, 1.23-3.48]; P=.006). There was no protective effect of elective cesarean section (CS) delivery on HCV vertical transmission (adjusted OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 0.86-2.48]; P=.16). HCV/human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected women more frequently transmitted HCV than did women with HCV infection only, although the difference was not statistically significant (adjusted OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 0.94-3.52]; P=.08). Maternal history of injection drug use, prematurity, and breast-feeding were not significantly associated with transmission. Transmission occurred more frequently from viremic women, but it also occurred from a few nonviremic women.CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that women should neither be offered an elective CS nor be discouraged from breast-feeding on the basis of HCV infection alone. The sex association is an intriguing finding that probably reflects biological differences in susceptibility or response to infection.","16267757"
"Low risk of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus in Yaounde, Cameroon: the ANRS 1262 study.","To assess mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Cameroon, 5,008 pregnant women were screened for HCV antibodies. Eighty-nine (1.8%) were HCV-antibody (HCV-Ab) positive. Among these, 7 (7.9%) were HBsAg positive, 6 (6.7%) HIV-positive, and one (1.1%) was co-infected by both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV. Sixty-eight (76%) out of 89 HCV-Ab positive pregnant women were HCV-RNA positive. The HCV genotype determination indicated the predominance of genotype 4 (45.3%), followed by the genotypes 1 (28.1%) and 2 (26.6%). The mean HCV-RNA levels of 41 women at the time of delivery was 4.8 (range 0.06-34.7) x 10(6) RNA copies/mL. Finally, 35 women delivered 36 live children. None of those screened at 6 weeks and 6 months of age were HCV-RNA positive. The failure to detect HCV vertical transmission suggests that the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is not a major route of HCV transmission in Cameroon.","16103623"
"Mother to child transmission of hepatitis C virus: rate of infection and risk factors.","To determine the rate of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and identify risk factors associated with HCV transmission we prospectively studied 86 infants born to anti-HCV positive mothers. HCV infection was verified in all mothers before delivery and their HCV viral load was measured at or near delivery using reverse transcription polymerase reaction. For HCV genotyping the INNO-LiPA II probe assay was used. All mothers were tested for HIV infection. Possible risk factors for vertical transmission were recorded. The children were followed up for a minimum of 18 months for evidence of HCV infection, as determined by persistent HCV antibodies, or detection of HCV-RNA. Vertical transmission was restricted to infants born to viraemic mothers and the rate was 3.6% (95% CI 0.004-0.123). The HIV-infected mothers and those using drugs intravenously were more likely to transmit HCV to their children. The infected children had the same genotype as their mothers. Although the HCV RNA titre was higher in mothers who transmitted the virus than in those who did not, the viral load had borderline significance (p=0.08). Viral transmission was not influenced by mother's age, mode of delivery, genotype or type of feeding. Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus is uncommon and restricted to infants born to HCV viraemic mothers. Active drug use and HIV coinfection increase the risk for HCV vertical transmission.","16051571"
"Successful treatment with tenofovir in a child C cirrhotic patient with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus awaiting liver transplantation. Post-transplant results.","Antiviral treatment can be complex in decompensated hepatitis B virus (HBV) cirrhosis because of potential emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants and worsening liver function, and to multifactorial nephrotoxicity. Negative HBV-DNA status by hybridization before liver transplantation is a favorable prognostic factor. We present the case of a 54-year-old HBV+ liver transplantation candidate who, after testing negative for HBV-DNA, developed YMDD lamivudine-resistant mutants resulting in a deteriorated clinical condition. After 8 months of adefovir plus lamivudine double therapy, only partial response was achieved. Tenofovir was added to this regimen, and an early decline of HBV-DNA was seen at 4 weeks without adverse events. The patient underwent transplantation. At 21-month postoperative follow-up, the patient's outcome was excellent. Post-transplantation HBV prophylaxis, taking into account the prior development of mutants, consists of hepatitis B immunoglobulin plus lamivudine and adefovir. Tenofovir was well tolerated and produced a fast antiviral response, suggesting its potential value in combined antiviral treatment for liver transplantation candidates.","15948869"
"Serum albumin and platelet count but not portal pressure are predictive of death in patients with Child-Pugh A hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis.","AIM: The presence of esophageal varices has been reported to be a prognostic factor in patients with compensated hepatitis viral C induced cirrhosis. We studied the prognostic value of hepatic venous pressure gradient in addition to epidemiological and clinical parameters in these patients.METHODS: Among patients with Child-Pugh A hepatitis C induced cirrhosis, prospectively followed in two Parisian centres, 100 had measurement of occluded and free hepatic venous pressures. We evaluated hepatic venous pressures as a predictive factor of death by Cox models (survival) and Fine and Gray models (liver-deaths).RESULTS: Median hepatic occluded pressure and gradient were 21.5 (15-24) and 13 mm Hg (9-15), respectively. The median duration of follow-up was 85 months (range: 70-112); 38 deaths or liver transplantation were registered. Hepatic venous pressure gradient was not significantly related to survival in the studied population but as a continuous variable was predictive of death from liver disease. On multivariable analysis serum albumin &lt;40 g/L and platelet count &lt;90,000 /mm(3) were the only selected prognostic factors.CONCLUSION: Hepatic venous pressure gradient has a limited value for assessing the prognosis of patients with Child-Pugh A hepatitis C virus induced cirrhosis; prognosis is accurately predicted by serum albumin and platelet count.","15864193"
"When does mother to child transmission of hepatitis C virus occur?","OBJECTIVE: To investigate when hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from mother to child occurs, and evaluate possible associated factors.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.PATIENTS: Fifty four HCV infected children tested within three days of birth and their mothers.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results.RESULTS: Seventeen of the children (31%, 95% confidence interval 19% to 46%) were positive in the first 3 days of life and could be assumed to have acquired infection in utero. Testing PCR positive was not associated with sex (53% v 49% boys; p=0.77) or mode of delivery (29% elective caesarean section in both groups; p=0.98). Children with evidence of intrauterine infection were significantly more likely to be of lower birth weight and infected with genotype 1 (58% v 12%, p=0.01). Although a higher proportion of infants born to HCV/HIV co-infected women were PCR positive in the first 3 days of life, this difference did not reach statistical significance; excluding infants born to co-infected women did not affect the results. Thirty seven of the children (68%) were negative in the first 3 days of life, 27 of whom were positive when tested again at 3 months, and nine were first PCR positive after 3 months (one child had no further tests).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that at least one third and up to a half of infected children acquired infection in utero. Although postpartum transmission cannot be excluded, these data suggest that it is rare. The role of HCV genotypes in the timing and mechanism of infection should be explored further.","15724041"
"Clinical features and molecular characterization of hepatitis A virus outbreak in a child care center in Thailand.","BACKGROUND: As a result of declining hepatitis A endemicity in Thailand, an increasing number of children and adolescents have become susceptible to hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection.OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed at both investigating the clinical features and determining molecular characterization of HAV during an outbreak, which occurred in a childcare center located in a suburban area of Bangkok between November 2002 and February 2003.METHODS: Serum samples obtained from all children in the center were tested for anti-HAV IgG and anti-HAV IgM. Testing for HAV-RNA was performed in sera, saliva and stool samples by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers located at the VP1-2A region. To further characterize the HAV genotype serum derived HAV-RNA-positive PCR products were sequenced.RESULTS: Anti-HAV IgG and anti-HAV IgM were detected in 74 and 70 of 112 children in the center, respectively. Among those positive for anti-HAV IgM, 65 cases were asymptomatic, while five children had acute clinical hepatitis. The ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic children was 1:13. Among the asymptomatic cases, 31 (47.7%) displayed biochemical hepatitis with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. All the isolates from this outbreak were found to be of subgenotype IA, which showed a high level of sequence homology with previous Thai isolates. HAV-RNA could not be detected in saliva, but was found in stool for at least 3 weeks after initial diagnosis of clinical or biochemical hepatitis.CONCLUSION: Because of the infection's characteristically asymptomatic spread, hepatitis A poses an increased risk to childcare centers. The presence of a single sub-genotype indicates that this HAV strain has been predominantly circulating in Thailand.","15572002"
"Sustained low alanine aminotransferase levels can predict the survival for 10 years without hepatocellular carcinoma development in patients with hepatitis C virus-associated liver cirrhosis of child stage A.","An analysis was performed of the patients with hepatitis C virus-associated liver cirrhosis (HCV-LC) who never developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for 10 years after the histological diagnosis of LC. Seventy-four consecutive HCV-LC patients of Child stage A were observed for &gt;10 years prospectively for the development of HCC with frequent ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Of the 63 patients who fulfilled the study, 48 patients were treated and 15 were nontreated because of their stable state. They were subdivided into three groups according to their serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels: the high ALT group comprised of 23 patients whose annual average serum ALT level was persistently high (&gt;/=80 IU); the low ALT group comprised of 28 patients whose annual average serum ALT level was persistently low (&lt;80 IU), and the unclassified ALT group comprised of 12 patients. In the low ALT group, as high as 71.4% of patients had never developed HCC for 10 years, in contrast to only 17.4% in the high ALT group (p &lt; 0.001). In the 30 patients who never developed HCC for 10 years, 20 patients belonged to the low ALT group, in contrast to only 4 belonging to the high ALT group. Sustained low ALT levels were important to survive for 10 years without developing HCC in the HCV-LC patients of Child stage A.","15192269"
"[Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus: recent news about the benefit of caesarean sections].","The rate of mother-to-infant transmission for hepatitis C virus is estimated to be around 5% of viraemic mothers and represents an important route of HCV infection among children. Transmission is possible in utero but the highest risk of infection is at or near the time of delivery because of an important blood transmission of hepatitis C virus. Mothers with high levels of HCV-RNA and co-infected for human immunodeficiency virus are documented to have risk factors for vertical transmission of HCV. Thus, for these, the mode of delivery must be discussed even if there are no precise recommendations. Among obstetrical risk factors, the results of literature fail to prove a benefit of elective caesarean delivery in the aim to reduce the vertical transmission of HCV. However, obstetrical situations with a high risk of blood contact between mother and foetus must be considered and if possible evicted.","14623563"
"[The correlation of Child-Pugh score, PGA index and MELD score in the patient with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma according to the cause of alcohol and hepatitis B virus].","AIMS: To determine the treatment modalities and the prognosis of a patient with liver cirrhosis, quantitative estimation of liver function is important. We assessed the Child-Pugh score (CPS), the common method as a severity index for the cirrhosis, the Prothrombin, gammaGT, and Apolipoprotein A1 (PGA) index and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between these indices in the patients with cirrhosis only and hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC), according to underlying causes (HBV and alcohol).METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 339 cirrhotic patients with/without hepatocellular carcinoma and divided patient groups by disease and underlying cause: cirrhosis caused by alcohol; LC-Al, cirrhosis caused by HBV; LC-B, hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis caused by alcohol; HCC-Al, hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis caused by HBV; HCC-B. We assessed the CPS, PGA index and MELD score and calculated the correlation coefficient between these scores.RESULTS: Among the total of 339 patients, 201 patients were diagnosed on the liver cirrhosis only, and 138 patients on the hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis. In each groups, mean score values were not significantly different in CPS, PGA index and MELD score. The correlation of CPS, PGA index and MELD score in all groups, except for the correlation of PGA index and MELD score in HCC-Al group, was significantly positive (p&lt;0.05). Compared to correlation coefficients between three indices, the patients with cirrhosis only had higher tendencies than the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The patients by HBV had higher tendencies than by alcohol.CONCLUSIONS: The correlations between CPS, PGA index and MELD score showed significantly positive correlations in the patients with liver cirrhosis only and hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis (except in HCC-Al group). The patients with cirrhosis only had higher correlation coefficients than the patients with PHC and the patients by HBV had higher than by alcohol.","12824750"
"Molecular evidence for transmission of GB virus-C/Hepatitis G virus infection within family: close relationship between mother and child.","AIMS: GBV-C/Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is transmitted parentally, but some of the transmitted routes are still unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship of family members in the transmission of HGV.METHODOLOGY: The study group enrolled 11 children from four index mothers with HGV viremia, whereas the control group had 14 children from seven matched mothers without HGV infection. Detection of circulating HGV RNA and anti-E2 antibody was conducted. Comparison of partially HGV nucleotide sequences at the 5' non-coding and non-structure 5 regions was performed among the infected family members.RESULTS: There was higher HGV viremia in children from the index mothers with HGV infection than those from mothers in control (3/11 vs. 0/14, p &lt; 0.05). Nucleotide sequences analysis showed higher similarity between mothers and their children in the same family (98.6% to 100%) than between mothers of different families (87.8% to 92.4%). The phylogenetic construction also demonstrated distinct sequence clusters for mother and child/children of each family.CONCLUSIONS: The relationship of HGV transmission between mother and children was closely related in family.

"Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis E virus infection.","OBJECTIVES: Water borne or enterically transmitted non-A-non-B hepatitis is a major public health problem in India. Many of these cases carry fatal outcome. The hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been considered to be the most important causative agent of this entity. The severity and fatality rates of HEV infection are reported to be rather more in pregnant women. However, there is meager information from India, on mother to child transmission of this agent.METHODS: During 1997-98, we studied 60 pregnant women suspected to have acute viral hepatitis to understand the frequency of various viral etiologies, disease course and outcome of the pregnancy. Six cord blood samples were tested for IgG, and IgM antibodies against hepatropic viral agents and also for hepatitis E virus RNA by RT-nested PCR using ORF-1 as target.RESULTS: Of the 60 pregnant patients hospitalised at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for acute hepatitis, 22 (37%) were positive for IgM anti-HEV antibodies and 10% were infected with hepatitis B virus. Co-infection of HEV with Hepatitis B and C was seen in 1 and 2 patents, respectively. Most (72%) of the HEV infected patients were in third trimester of pregnancy (P&lt;0.05). Of the 6 cord blood samples tested 3 (50%) were positive for HEV RNA. Though, all mothers were RNA positive, half of the babies did not get infected in utero with HEV. Fourteen of the 22 (63.6%) HEV infected mothers developed fulminant hepatic failure and all died.CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in HEV [corrected] infected mothers was 100%. Mother to child transmission of hepatitis E virus infection was established in 50%.","12619951"
"Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus infection.","The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among pregnant women in Europe is generally below 2%. Although women with a history of parenteral exposures or injecting drug use are at an increased risk of infection, a substantial proportion of infected women do not report any risk factors. Targeted screening is thus not recommended. The risk of mother-to-child, or vertical, transmission of HCV is about 5% overall but can be as high as 15%, depending on maternal HIV infection status and HCV RNA viral load. Larger studies are needed to confirm or refute the potential protective effect of elective cesarean section delivery. However, for HCV-positive women who are co-infected with HIV, elective cesarean section delivery is associated with a reduced risk of vertical transmission of HIV as well as HCV. The risk of postnatal transmission through breastfeeding cannot be excluded but is likely to be low for most HCV-infected women. The long-term natural history of vertically acquired HCV needs further elucidation and the efficacy of potential therapies for infected children need to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.","12532168"
"Mixed infection of a child care provider with hepatitis A virus isolates from subgenotypes IA and IB revealed by heteroduplex mobility assay.","Phylogenetic analysis based on a 168 base segment encompassing the putative VP1/2A junction of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) genome has enabled the classification of HAV isolates into seven genotypes (I-VII). Genotype I, which includes the vast majority of the human HAV isolates, has been divided further into subgenotypes IA and IB. An heteroduplex mobility assay was designed with amplification products from the VP1/2A junction region, and used as a genotyping method able to discriminate HAV isolates belonging to IA, IB and non-I genotypes. The method was used to successfully genotype 48 samples (16 IA and 32 IB). However, one HAV RNA positive serum sample (AUX-23), collected from a 15 year old female employed at a child care center located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, showed an unusual pattern. PCR products from sample AUX-23 gave rise to heteroduplex bands when mixed with IA products as well as with IB products, suggesting the presence of HAV isolates from both subgenotypes in the serum. PCR products from sample AUX-23 were then cloned and 20 clones were analyzed by heteroduplex mobility assay. Eleven were subgenotype IA and 9 were IB. Three clones of each subgenotype were then sequenced to confirm the results. These data constitute the first report of mixed infection of a single individual with different HAV isolates.","12505637"

"Seroconversion after the addition of famciclovir therapy in a child with hepatitis B virus infection after liver transplantation who developed lamivudine resistance.","There is very little information about hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in children after liver transplantation. This is the first report of the addition of famciclovir in a child who developed lamivudine resistance.A 5-year-old boy who was serum HBsAg-negative and was not vaccinated against HBV underwent living-related liver transplantation for fulminant hepatitis A. The donor was his mother, who was serum HBcAb-positive. No immunoprophylaxis was administered. HBV infection developed after 18 months and was treated with 3 mg/kg daily of lamivudine. Serum alanine aminotransferase normalized and HBV DNA load decreased significantly. Sixteen months later, lamivudine resistance developed; a mutation (M552I) was confirmed by sequencing through the YMDD locus of the HBV polymerase gene. The addition of 750 mg daily of famciclovir led to seroconversion and the disappearance of serum HBV DNA. Lamivudine in combination with famciclovir might be a therapeutic option for HBV reinfection after liver transplantation, also in children. Suppression of viral replication to undetectable values is possible even in the lamivudine-resistant mutant.","11907436"
"Maternal drug use is a preeminent risk factor for mother-to-child hepatitis C virus transmission: results from a multicenter study of 1372 mother-infant pairs.","This prospective multicenter study evaluated separately the significance of maternal injection drug use (IDU) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfection in vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV). In all, 1372 consecutive, unselected HCV antibody-positive mothers and their infants were studied. Maternal HIV-1 coinfection (crude odds ratios [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.66; P =.007) and IDU (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.37-1.78; P &lt;.00001) were linked to mother-to-child HCV transmission in unadjusted analysis when all anti-HCV-positive mothers were evaluated. When only HCV RNA-positive mothers were evaluated, maternal IDU, but not maternal HIV-1 coinfection, was significantly associated with mother-to-child HCV transmission. Multivariable analysis confirmed the link between maternal IDU and HCV transmission (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.19-1.92; P =.0006), but no association was found with HIV-1 coinfection (AOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.73-1.33; P =.93). IDU, but not HIV-1 coinfection, seems to be a preeminent risk factor for vertical HCV transmission.","11865412"
"Prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in a cohort of pregnant women in northern Greece and transmission of HCV from mother to child.","The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the mother-to-child transmission of HCV were studied in 2408 pregnant women. Positive antiHCV were detected in 47 women (1.95%), 21 of whom (44.7%) were HCVRNA(+), but only seven had abnormal aminotransferases. Three/21 HCVRNA(+) women had an abortion. We lost contact with other 10 women. Thirty-four babies were tested for antiHCV, HCVRNA and levels of aminotransferases at birth and at the age of 6 and 12 months. AntiHCV were detectable in all babies at birth and these maternally acquired antibodies disappeared by the age of 12 months in all but two of who were infected with HCV. HCVRNA was detected at birth in one (6.25%) baby born out of 16 HCVRNA(+) mothers and this baby also had abnormal aminotransferases. However, HCVRNA was undetectable and aminotransferases returned to normal levels by the age of 6 months. In another baby born also from an HCVRNA(+) mother, the HCVRNA was detected for the first time at the age of 12 months. The HCV genotype from both babies was the same as their mother's. These results show that (a) the high prevalence in the group of pregnant women studied can possibly be attributed to the fact that 311/2408 (12.91%) of them came from the former eastern countries, where disposable syringes were not used but lately or were ex-drug addicts and (b) there is a low risk of perinatal mother-to-child transmission of HCV and this risk is related to the presence of HCVRNA in the carrier mother.","11680545"
"Reactivation of precore variant hepatitis B virus in a child with severe aplastic anaemia.","Reactivation of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection due to selection of precore variant virus is an uncommon complication of previous hepatitis B infection, and virtually unrecognised in children and adolescents. A child who had received treatment with methylprednisolone and antilymphocyte globulin for severe aplastic anaemia developed high levels of detectable HBV DNA associated with hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe) positivity. HBV DNA was extracted, amplified and the core and precore regions sequenced from 2 samples. A mixture of wild-type and the precore variants A(1896) and A(1899) was detected in both samples, with the wild-type predominating in the second sample. Reinfection was excluded by phylogenetic analysis using Phylip and the neighbour-joining method. Precore variant Hepatitis B virus can be transmitted to children as a primary infection, and it is important that aggressive liver disease, particularly in the presence of the anti-HBe phenotype, be investigated. Further studies are needed to determine the frequency of these variants.","11596080"
"Presence of oligoclonal T cells in cerebrospinal fluid of a child with multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis following hepatitis A virus infection.","We have investigated the clonality of beta-chain T-cell receptor (TCR) transcripts from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood from a 7-year old child who developed a multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis following an infection with hepatitis A virus. We amplified beta-chain TCR transcripts by nonpalindromic adaptor (NPA)-PCR-Vbeta-specific PCR. TCR transcripts from only five Vbeta families (Vbeta13, Vbeta3, Vbeta17, Vbeta8, and Vbeta20) were detected in CSF. The amplified products were combined, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed in the CSF substantial proportions of identical beta-chain of TCR transcripts, demonstrating oligoclonal populations of T cells. Seventeen of 35 (48%) transcripts were 100% identical, demonstrating a major Vbeta13.3 Dbeta2.1 Jbeta1.3 clonal expansion. Six of 35 (17%) transcripts were also 100% identical, revealing a second Vbeta13 clonal expansion (Vbeta13.1 Dbeta2.1 Jbeta1.2). Clonal expansions were also found within the Vbeta3 family (transcript Vbeta3.1 Dbeta2.1 Jbeta1.5 accounted for 5 of 35 transcripts [14%]) and within the Vbeta20 family (transcript Vbeta20.1 Dbeta1.1 Jbeta2.4 accounted for 3 of 35 transcripts [8%]). These results demonstrate the presence of T-cell oligoclonal expansions in the CSF of this patient following infection with hepatitis A virus. Analysis of the CDR3 motifs revealed that two of the clonally expanded T-cell clones exhibited substantial homology to myelin basic protein-reactive T-cell clones. In contrast, all Vbeta TCR families were expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Oligoclonal expansions of T cells were not detected in the peripheral blood of this patient. It remains to be determined whether these clonally expanded T cells are specific for hepatitis A viral antigen(s) or host central nervous system antigen(s) and whether molecular mimicry between hepatitis A viral protein and a host protein is responsible for demyelinating disease in this patient.","11527815"

"Effects of mode of delivery and infant feeding on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus. European Paediatric Hepatitis C Virus Network.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of mode of delivery and infant feeding on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus.DESIGN: Pooled retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.SAMPLE: Data on hepatitis C virus seropositive mothers and their children identified around delivery were sent from 24 centres of the European Paediatric Hepatitis C Virus Network.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hepatitis C virus infection status of children born to hepatitis C virus infected women.RESULTS: A total of 1,474 hepatitis C virus infected women were identified, of whom 503 (35%) were co-infected with HIV. Co-infected women were more than twice as likely to transmit hepatitis C virus to their children than women with hepatitis C virus infection alone. Overall 9.2% (136/1,474) of children were hepatitis C virus infected. Among the women with hepatitis C virus infection-only, multivariate analyses did not show a significant effect of mode of delivery and breastfeeding: caesarean section vs vaginal delivery OR = 1.17, P = 0.66; breastfed versus non-breastfed OR = 1.07, P = 0.83. However, HIV co-infected women delivered by caesarean section were 60% less likely to have an infected child than those delivered vaginally (OR = 0.36, P = 0.01) and those who breastfed were about four times more likely to infect their children than those who did not (OR = 6.41, P = 0.03). HIV infected children were three to four times more likely also to be hepatitis C virus infected than children without HIV infection (crude OR = 3.76, 95% CI 1.89-7.41).CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support a recommendation of elective caesarean section or avoidance of breastfeeding for women with hepatitis C virus infection only, but the case for HIV infected women undergoing caesarean section delivery and avoiding breastfeeding is strengthened if they are also hepatitis C virus infected.","11305543"
"Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus: evidence for preventable peripartum transmission.","BACKGROUND: Little information is available about the timing of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and no interventions to decrease transmission rates have been identified. We examined the effect of risk factors, including mode of delivery, on the vertical transmission rate.METHODS: Data from HCV-infected women and their infants from three hospitals in Ireland and from a British Paediatric Surveillance Unit study of infants born to HCV-infected mothers were used to estimate the vertical transmission rate and risk factors for transmission. We used a probabilistic model using methods that simultaneously estimated the time to HCV-antibody loss in uninfected infants and the diagnostic accuracy of PCR tests for HCV RNA.FINDINGS: 441 mother-child pairs from the UK (227) and Ireland (214) were included. 50% of uninfected children became HCV-antibody negative by 8 months and 95% by 13 months. The estimated specificity of PCR for HCV RNA was 97% (95% CI 96-99) and was unrelated to age; sensitivity was only 22% (7-46) in the first month but rose sharply to 97% (85-100) thereafter. The vertical transmission rate was 6.7% (4.1-10.2) overall, and 3.8 times higher in HIV coinfected (n=22) than in HIV-negative women after adjustment for other factors (p=0.06). No effect of breastfeeding on transmission was observed, although only 59 women breastfed. However, delivery by elective caesarean section before membrane rupture was associated with a lower transmission risk than vaginal or emergency caesarean-section delivery (odds ratio 0 [0-0.87], p=0.04, after adjustment for other factors).INTERPRETATION: The low sensitivity of HCV RNA soon after birth and the finding of a lower transmission rate after delivery by elective caesarean section suggest that HCV transmission occurs predominantly around the time of delivery. If the findings on elective caesarean section are confirmed in other studies, the case for antenatal HCV testing should be reconsidered.","11036896"
"Prospective reevaluation of risk factors in mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus: high virus load, vaginal delivery, and negative anti-NS4 antibody.","Of 21,791 pregnant women screened in Tottori Prefecture, Japan, 127 (0.58%) were positive for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and 84 (0.39%) were positive for HCV RNA. Of 84 children followed up for at least 6 months, 7 (8%) were infected. All of them were born to 26 mothers with a high virus load (HVL; &gt;/=2.5x106 RNA copies/mL [27%]), compared with 0 of 58 children born to non-HVL mothers (P&lt;.001). Because all the infected children were vaginally delivered, the infection rate among 16 vaginally delivered children born to the HVL mothers was as high as 44%. The prevalence of anti-NS4 antibody in the mothers with an infectious HVL was significantly lower than that in the mothers with a noninfectious HVL (P=.048). Analysis of our results suggests that maternal HVL, vaginal delivery, and negative anti-NS4 antibody are significant risk factors for the mother-to-child transmission of HCV.","11023474"
"[Mother-child transmission of hepatitis B virus. State of the problem and prevention].","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide problem of public health. Mother/child transmission of the virus represents a major factor in maintaining the infection, which is often transmitted during delivery, the risk of transmission of the HBV depending on the degree of maternal infectiosity, the genomic type of the virus, and the rate of maternal antibodies. Evolution towards chronicity of the infected newborn is frequent. The available means to prevent the mother/child transmission of the virus are efficient. Once HBV maternal infection is diagnosed during pregnancy, joint administration of vaccine and specific immunoglobulins to the baby in the early neonatal period efficiently prevent the mother/child transmission of the virus.","10985190"

TTV DNA was detected in 47.8% (n = 22) of the women. All but one child born to these women were also viremic for TTV from the first sample onward. TTV DNA was found in 73.9% (n = 17) of the breast milk samples derived from TTV viremic mothers. The one TTV-negative child born to a viremic mother remained negative during follow-up, although it was breast-fed. Our data show that TTV is highly effectively transmitted from mothers to their children during pregnancy. Although the majority of breast milk samples from viremic mothers are positive by TTV PCR, there is no need to discourage women from breast-feeding, because most children are TTV viremic even before breast-feeding begins.","10655378"

"Phylogenetic analysis to document a common source of hepatitis D virus infection in a mother and her child.","BACKGROUND: Spread of hepatitis D virus (HDV) from mother to infant is rare and nucleotide evidence to document such transmission is lacking. The aim of this study was to screen the children of HDV-infected parents and compare the HDV nucleotide sequence between children and parents by phylogenetic analysis.METHODS: Fifty-seven children of 28 HDV-infected parents (23 fathers and 5 mothers, including two couples) were enrolled. HDV genomes from sera of HDV-infected parents and their children were cloned and sequenced. Comparison and phylogenetic analysis of HDV genomes were based on a region from nucleotide 911 to 1260. The homology to nucleotide sequence among different genotypes was estimated by phylogenetic analysis.RESULTS: One of the eight children whose mothers were anti-HDV positive was positive for anti-HDV. Mean heterogeneity among different HDV clones from a single subject ranged from 0.29% to 1.15%. HDV sequences from the mother and her child (referred from southern Taiwan) were nearly identical (99.7%), both showed 92.2-93.4% homology with other genotype II isolates from north Taiwan and 76.3-77.1% homology with genotype I isolates.CONCLUSIONS: Genotype II HDV is most prevalent in Taiwan. There are significant variations up to 8% in nucleotide sequence among different genotype II HDV clones isolated from patients in northern and southern Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HDV clones from the mother and her child form a monophyletic group, supporting a common source of infection.

Tuscany Study Group on Hepatitis C Virus Infection.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for and timing of vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus in women who are not infected with HIV-1.DESIGN: Follow up for a median of 28 (range 24-38) months of babies born to women with antibodies to hepatitis C virus but not HIV-1.SUBJECTS: 442 mothers and babies, of whom 403 completed the study.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus and viral RNA and alanine aminotransferase activity in babies. Presence of viral RNA, method of infection with hepatitis C, method of delivery, and type of infant feeding in mothers.RESULTS: 13 of the 403 children had acquired hepatitis C virus infection at the end of follow up. All these children were born to women positive for hepatitis C virus RNA; none of the 128 RNA negative mothers passed on the infection (difference 5%, 95% confidence interval 2% to 7%). 6 children had viral RNA immediately after birth. 111 women had used intravenous drugs and 20 had received blood transfusions. 11 of the infected children were born to these women compared with 2 to the 144 with no known risk factor (difference 7%, 2% to 12%).CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in women not infected with HIV only those with hepatitis C virus RNA are at risk of infecting their babies. Transmission does seem to occur in utero, and the rate of transmission is higher in women who have had blood transfusions or used intravenous drugs than in women with no known risk factor for infection.","9703524"
"Homology of E2 gene in 8 child-mother pairs infected with hepatitis C virus.","The frequency of genetic homology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) E2 gene in 8 child-mother pairs was investigated. The route of HCV infection of all children suggested mother-to-child infection by their past history. In this study, we analyzed at least 5 complementary DNA (cDNA) clones for each case. In 6 of the 8 (75%) child-mother pairs, for the region between hypervariable region (HVR)-1 and HVR-2, the similarity of the nucleotide sequence of all 5 cDNA clones between each child and the mother was higher than that between the child and the other children, the other mothers and the sequences from GenBank. One of the 8 (13%) child-mother pairs showed a great similarity in parts of all cDNA clones. This was also confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of cDNA clones from families and that from GenBank.

Six (5%) children were perinatally infected with HCV as shown by RT-PCR. None of the infected children had clinical signs of hepatitis. None of the pregnancies was complicated by abortion, stillbirth, premature birth, or malformation of the child. Special concern was given to the possibility of HCV transmission via breast milk. In no breast milk sample obtained from 34 HCV-infected mothers was HCV RNA detected.

"Mother-to-child transmission of a hepatitis C virus variant with an insertional mutation in its hypervariable region.","AIMS: We have analyzed the molecular basis of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus.RESULTS: Healthy pregnant women were screened for anti-HCV antibody and babies born to hepatitis C virus carrier mothers were prospectively investigated. Among the 35 pairs studied, the hepatitis C virus genome was detectable in only one baby, who did not show any significant symptoms of hepatitis. The viral load in the blood of the mother was one of the highest of the 35, and the population of the hepatitis C virus genome was heterogeneous. Furthermore, she was found to have a mixed infection with type 1a and type 1b hepatitis C virus. However, the hepatitis C virus genome obtained from the baby was only from type 1b, less heterogeneous and composed of the clones which were detected in the blood of the mother. The selected hepatitis C virus had a 12-nucleotide insertion in the amino-terminus of the E2 hypervariable region of the genome.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus from carrier mothers was shown by this prospective study to be low. The presence of selection pressure during transmission was suggested. The biological significance of the virus with 12-nucleotide insertion has to be determined.","8938534"
"Human immunodeficiency virus infection as risk factor for mother-to-child hepatitis C virus transmission; persistence of anti-hepatitis C virus in children is associated with the mother's anti-hepatitis C virus immunoblotting pattern.","To determine the rate of vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV), we prospectively studied 45 babies born to anti-HCV-positive women with or without concomitant infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We performed a second-generation recombinant immunoblotting assay, alanine transaminase (ALT) evaluation, and HCV-RNA testing on sera from 27 infants of HCV+, HIV- mothers and 18 babies of HCV+, HIV+ women, at birth and thereafter. After birth, HCV antibodies progressively disappeared within 12 months in all children but one, whose mother was HCV+, HIV+; this child was the only one who showed detectable levels of HCV-RNA and abnormal ALT values throughout the follow-up (range, 12 to 27 months). Viremia was persistently negative, and ALT levels were continuously normal in the remaining infants, showing that &quot;seronegative&quot; infection with HCV was absent in both groups. Clearance of passively acquired anti-HCV antibodies was found to be slower among babies born to HIV+ mothers (22.3% vs. 3.8% at 12 months, P = .03) and children whose mothers showed three or four anti-HCV reactivities by immunoblotting maintained anti-HCV for longer periods compared with babies born to mothers with one or two anti-HCV reactivities (P = .0001). Seventeen of 27 babies born to HCV+, HIV- mothers were breast-fed, and none of them was infected, confirming the apparent safety for HCV of breast milk. In summary, according to our study, vertical transmission of HCV is an infrequent event, and the presence of HIV in the mother is not an important co-factor for transmission of HCV infection.","7843701"

"[Mother-child transmission of hepatitis B virus in the Tunisian Sahel].","In order to assess the importance of mother-child transmission of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the Tunisian Sahel, 81 HBsAg-positive mothers have been selected at delivery in a representative sample of 1940 who delivered in maternities of this region. Each HBsAg-positive mother was matched for age and parity particularly with two HBsAg-negative mothers. Children born to these 66 HBsAg+ and 120 HBsAg- mothers were traced at 28 months and tested by ELISA for HBV serologic markers (HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc). The distribution of these markers was significantly different according to the maternal status for HBsAg. The overall prevalence rate of HBV markers was higher in children born to HBsAg+ mothers as compared to children born to HBsAg- mothers (33.3% vs 13.3%, OR = 2.5, 95% CI:1.4-4.2). For HBsAg, the figures were 27.3% and 9.2% respectively (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.5-5.9). Given the prevalence rate of HBsAg in mothers (4.2%), the role of mother-child transmission in the spread of HBV infection and the intensity and precocity of horizontal transmission, systemic vaccination against HBV at birth should be recommended in the Tunisian Sahel in the context of the EPI. However this decision should take into account, in terms of cost/efficacy ratio, the other public health problems concerning this area.","7816966"
"Studies on transmission of hepatitis C virus from mother-to-child in the perinatal period.","To elucidate whether breast milk, vaginal discharge and contamination with maternal blood at birth are possible routes of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV), we examined HCV RNA in the cord and peripheral blood of infants, and in the blood, vaginal discharge, and breast milk of anti-HCV seropositive mothers. From July 1991 to July 1992, we studied 20 healthy pregnant women, who were seropositive with the Ortho anti-HCV EIA, and their infants. Using a sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR), we investigated the presence or absence of hepatitis C virus in the above-mentioned specimens. Moderate elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed in only one woman in the first and third trimesters. The nested PCR and subsequent Southern hybridization detected 0.5-5.5 copies of HCV c-DNA. HCV RNA was detected in 17/20 blood samples (85%), 7/14 vaginal discharge samples (50%) and 4/10 cord blood samples (40%). However, no HCV RNA was identified in the peripheral blood of infants or breast milk. The mother-to-child transmission of HCV at delivery or via breast milk does not appear to contribute much to maintaining the global HCV reservoir.","8250598"
"Silent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus through two generations determined by comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the viral cDNA.","To investigate the routes of transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a family in which HCV was considered to be transmitted from mother to child through two generations was studied. By the polymerase chain reaction method, HCV cDNA was isolated from the serum of a female baby with self-limited hepatitis C. HCV cDNA was also obtained from her mother and grandmother, who are healthy carriers of HCV, as well as from her uncle suffering from chronic persistent hepatitis C. The nucleotide sequence of the HCV cDNA fragment obtained from the baby was identical to that of the mother and was much closer to those of the grandmother and the uncle than to HCV cDNA isolates previously obtained from other Japanese patients or carriers. These results indicate the presence of mother-to-child transmission of HCV and suggest a role of this transmission route in establishing HCV carriers and maintaining a high incidence of HCV infection.","1331256"
"Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus detected by nested polymerase chain reaction.","Serum samples from eight pregnant women and their offspring were studied by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA to evaluate mother-to-child transmission of this virus. The mothers were all infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); none showed symptoms of HCV infection. Anti-HCV antibodies were tested for by recombinant immunoblot assay. HCV viral sequences were found in five of the mothers and four of eight children, three of them at birth. Viremia was persistent in one infant who had chronic transaminase elevation and persistently remained anti-HCV-positive. The other three babies had intermittent viremia; all were asymptomatic and lost anti-HCV antibodies during follow-up. This loss of antibodies was also observed in PCR-negative infants. Thus, these results demonstrate transmission of HCV from mother to child by women coinfected with HCV and HIV. They indicate the usefulness of PCR for direct and early detection of HCV viremia in neonates.","1313070"

"[Transmission of hepatitis B virus from mother to child in Bamako-Mali].","Results of a study about mother-infant transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) confirm the high degree of positivity of HBV markers in Bamako, Republic of Mali. Among 372 sera of mother-newborn pairs, seroprevalence of HBs Ag has been around 11% in mothers. The lack of anti HBc IgM in all sera agree probably with a relative old contamination. Pre-S2 epitope marker has been found in more than 70% of HBs Ag positive mothers and 50% of their children. Large discordance has been noted between the prevalence rate of this marker and the HBe Ag and viral DNA, other markers of HBV replication. Further studies are necessary for the clear understanding of HBV transmission systems in our country.","1596959"

"Effects of booster HB vaccine in preventing hepatitis B virus infection from mother to child.","Hepatitis B immune serum 200 IU was injected intramuscularly to 127 infants born to hepatitis B e antigen positive mothers immediately after birth and at two months of age, and if necessary at four months. HB adjuvant vaccine 20 micrograms was injected subcutaneously at three, four, and six months. If antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen were 2(2) or less, one to four doses of booster vaccine 20 micrograms were given. The first booster vaccination was given in 8.7% of cases by the age of one year, in 19.3% by 18 months, in 23.9% by 24 months, and in 36.2% by 30 months; thus 2-to-3-year-old infants were more frequently vaccinated than younger ones. This implies that 80%-90% of infants could be protected from vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) up to the age of three years, if a booster vaccine was given to those born to HBeAg positive mothers not later than 24 months. Infants obtained enough antibody to prevent HBV infection by receiving one booster vaccination in 34 cases, by two in nine, by three in five, and by four in two.","2533789"
"Mother to child transmission of hepatitis B virus in the Philippines.","A follow-up study of mother to infant transmission of hepatitis B virus was conducted in the Philippines between 1981 and 1983. The prevalence of HBsAg among 527 mothers was 8.5%. Overall, seven out of 17 (41.2%) infants born to HBsAg carrier mothers became HBsAg positive within the first 12 months of life. The risk of becoming HBsAg positive was about 20 times higher for infants born to HBsAg positive mothers than for infants born to HBsAg negative mothers (OR = 18.9, 95% Ci = 2.0-86.6). The risk was even higher if the mother was a carrier of both HBsAg und HBeAg (OR = 91.0, 95% Ci = 49.2-164.8). However, the risk of transmission was very low if the mother was an HBsAg carrier and anti-HBe positive. It was estimated that mother to infant transmission accounts for about one third of HBsAg positivity at one year of age. The implications of these findings in the planning of vaccination campaigns to prevent HBV infections are discussed.","2599650"
"Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus in a semirural population in Egypt.","A follow-up study for one year was made on 35 babies born to HBsAg positive mothers in a semirural population in Egypt. Five of 21 babies (24%) showed HBsAg in the umbilical cord blood and remained positive throughout the observation period. At 3 months, eight of 37 babies (23%) were HBsAg + ve. At 6 months, 13 of 35 babies (37%) were HBsAg + ve and they were also still found positive at 12 months. None of 30 babies born to HBsAg-ve mothers developed antigenaemia throughout the observation period. Factors which significantly contributed to transmission were maternal educational level, family socio-economic standard, family residence, maternal e/anti-e status, and maternal schistosomal infestation. Factors which did not significantly affect transmission were maternal age, maternal parasitic non-schistosomal infestations, maternal transaminases level, order of the child in the family, and type of child feeding. Of particular note, four of five babies (80%) born to HBsAg + ve mothers who as well had schistosomiasis were HBsAg + ve throughout the observation period.","2918575"
"Chronic active hepatitis in a child with human immunodeficiency virus infection.","The pathologic changes in the liver of a child with human immunodeficiency virus infection are described. The liver biopsy specimens show chronic active hepatitis with bile duct damage. To our knowledge, the etiology and pathogenesis of chronic liver disease in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is not known. In this child, chronic active hepatitis is probably related to hepatitis B.","3415442"

"Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA-positive hepatocellular carcinoma following hepatitis B virus infection in a child.","Integrated hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA sequences were found in neoplastic liver tissue of a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative child who had previously suffered from HBsAg-positive chronic active hepatitis and was anti-HBs and anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) positive at the time of tumor development. Reintegration pattern was consistent with the presence of a single integration site of the HBV genome into cellular DNA, and clonal proliferation of such infected cells. A normal liver, tested in the same experiment with the same amount of total DNA, was negative for viral DNA sequences. These findings support the possible oncogenic role of HBV in the development of liver cancer, not only in adults, but also in children, even in patients who are negative for HBsAg at the time of tumor diagnosis.","2824681"
"Maternal-child hepatitis B virus transmission in Singapore.","A study of maternal-infant transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was conducted in Singapore between June 1980 and June 1982. HBsAg carrier rate was highest among Chinese (6.2%) followed by Malay (2.3%) and Indian (0.6%) mothers. The presence of HBeAg in maternal sera correlated well with high titre HBsAg (p = 7.34 X 10(-5)). Overall HBV transmission occurred in 27/56 (48.2%) infants from carrier mothers. The majority of the transmission was perinatal. There was a very strong correlation between transmission and HBeAg status of the mother (p = 1.85 X 10(-9); odds ratio = 68.44) and to a lesser extent with high titre HBsAg (p = 0.002; odds ratio = 6.38). A strong negative correlation was seen between transmission and anti-HBeAg (p = 8.19 X 10(-7); odds ratio = 0.04). At one year 19 (70.4%) infants were still HBsAg positive while seven (25.9%) lost the antigenemia and acquired anti-HBsAg and one developed HBsAg after one year. It could be calculated that perinatal HBV transmission contributed about 18% to the total pool of HBsAg positive infants of one year of age.","3988432"

"Membranous glomerulonephritis in a child asymptomatic for hepatitis B virus. Concomitant seropositivity for HBsAG and anti-HBs.","The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in association with immunoglobulins and complement components within the glomerular basement membranes of adults having chronic active hepatitis has been well documented. In addition, investigators in Poland have demonstrated HBsAg immune complexes in glomeruli of children who did not have clinical evidence of hepatitis. More recently, a single case of childhood membranous glomerulonephritis in an asymptomatic carrier of hepatitis B virus was cited by observers in Canada. Reported here is the deposition of HBsAg immune complexes in the glomerular basement membranes of a 13-year-old black boy who had membranous glomerulopathy but not clinical evidence of hepatitis. This may be the first reported case in the United States of HbsAg-associated membranous glomerulonephritis in a child asymptomatic for hepatitis B  virus, and only the second such case in North America. However, unlike previous studies of childhood glomerulopathy in association with hepatitis B virus, this patient is seropositive for both HBsAg and anti-HBs (antibody for hepatitis B surface antigen). Similar &quot;rare&quot; serologic findings were found for the patient's eldest male sib.","7013471"
